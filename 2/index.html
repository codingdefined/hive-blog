I thought people think that Money, Connections, Knowledge, Wisdom, or Intelligence is their true power, but though they are the power to the individuals basically there are potential energies which a human being acquire in their lifetime.

![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmTG3ovR9Wjnh8awjyeGNVMa6LUUVFsrNBEpXQnmdrRKrc/image.png)

A lot of people have these energies and it depends on person to person. Not everyone has a lot of everything but everyone has something and its divided between Money, Connections, Knowledge, Wisdom, or Intelligence. People will have some money saved up, have some knowledge and experience which is gained over the years as well as some intelligence. I am saying some because its hard to find people who have an abundance of everything. There might be some people, but very few if we compare them with the masses.

But the question is what is powerful among these all, shouldn't get surprised if I say that none of the above are powerful. If you do not want to use any of them, they will not come to you and say that use me i.e. they are not useful until you use it.

The true power for any individual is the power of Getting Started, i.e. taking Initiative. Everyone would have left Steem if the community wouldn't have started HIVE. Thus starting HIVE is the most powerful thing similarly as an individual starting something is the most powerful thing can happen. There might be a lot of people who might be having more money or resources, they might be more skilled but one thing which can differentiate between you and others is to start something new. Successful people always keep starting something new, they go from Zero to One and then One to 100.

![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmd8zUUJLBqF22duRvA4aR8jyJnZ5Mv562ox4hBdHh18r4/image.png)

When HIVE was started we were just 0, where the price was around $0.8, after a month we have moved more than $0.80, thus if we wouldn't have started we wouldn't have been son successful then we are now. We are getting som much attention in the crypto world even though we don't have any prominent names which are leading us because we believe that as a community we can be better and thus started.

Have anyone thought of price reaching $0.80 in such as short time? Now because successful people just start and they don't think of too far. They live in a present and try to be better every day. As an Individual, like me are always lazy and thus have a resistance to start something new. There might be hundreds of reasons we tell to ourselves before starting, i.e. If I do it I will do it perfectly, this will not be successful or there might be someone doing it who will do it better than me, etc and thus we don't get started.

There are also people (like me) who just delay the execution of the ideas and thus the execution never happens. I always wanted to build Stack Overflow on Steem and started working on it but the enthusiasm died of basically because even though I have started I have not able to keep the momentum going. This is again a problem if you start something to try to complete it to the alpha phase at least. That's the reason I am not successful because successful people have learned to get started and get the momentum going even though they face many obstacles in between.

Say, for example, you have an idea to write a book. Open a doc and start writing and don't wait for the perfect time or to write everything at once. Try to write the first 4 chapters which will take 10-15 minutes. Then you should continue it every day and in no time you have the initial copy of the book ready. 

Along with the Getting Started, we need to uphold the commitments we made to yourself, it's very easy to make commitments but it's hard to keep up with the commitments. When a friend of yours break commitments a lot of time then the relationship becomes sour, similarly, if we break the commitments made to ourself then we will blame yourself and you will feel bad about yourself. This shouldn't happen, to be successful you need to feel great all the time.

It is you who will be benefited from the commitments. You will be happy all the time, you will love yourself. You can count on you, saying if no one is there for you, You will be always with You. That is you are the best person in your life. So if you start something, be committed and then love yourself.

So, you have to get started Now and keep the commitment that you will continue it until it gets finished.

So get started.</p></section></article><article><header><h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4375rem"><a style="box-shadow:none" href="/hive-blog/franklin-india-shuts-down-6-debt-funds">Franklin India shuts down 6 debt funds</a></h3><small>April 27, 2020</small></header><section><img class="img-body" srcSet="https://images.hive.blog/DQmQjHdakaDDr66fjUuMaQR5Wdm8KV9JK1739wE9CgNZvc2/image.png" alt="franklin-india-shuts-down-6-debt-funds"/><p class="hive-body">Recently we have received a news that Franklin India has decided to shut down the following 6 debt funds Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund. That means new investments or redemptions/withdrawals from these funds will not be possible from 24 April 2020.

![](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQjHdakaDDr66fjUuMaQR5Wdm8KV9JK1739wE9CgNZvc2/image.png)

Franklin India said that these debt funds were facing redemption pressure i.e. too many investors are trying to redeem from these funds and thus liquidity has been the problem for them. Now because of this pressure, Franklin has to sell their assets at very poor prices. Now shutting down these funds will allow Franklin to sell assets gradually at better prices.

Now, what will happen to existing investors, including me. I have invested around $400 in Franklin India Ultra Short Fund. I have invested in this fund to have some debt exposure because I do not want to invest only in equity funds.

Today I dot an email from the President of Franklin India, Sanjay Sapre which gives all the information about why Franklin decided to shut down the funds and what will happen to the investor money.

>Dear Investor,

>I am personally writing to you today, to address some immediate concerns created by some well-intentioned but factually incorrect reporting across various media channels. Let me provide some clarifications point by point:

> 1: Reported: Winding up of the schemes means that my money is lost

>Fact: This is factually incorrect. We have communicated the reasons and market circumstances that led us to take this extremely difficult decision which was taken purely to protect value for our investors. As the schemes liquidate portfolio holdings subject to market conditions, receive coupon payments and scheduled maturities, the Trustees will start to return monies to investors at the earliest instance in compliance with regulation 41(2)(b) of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations 1996.

>2: Reported: The schemes invested in risky, unrated papers

>Fact: The schemes followed a consistent investment strategy of investing in investment grade papers across the credit rating spectrum, that is to say, from AAA through to A rated papers. This strategy served the schemes and its investors well till recent times. The schemes were able to generate significant cash flows even during the last 6 months which were more turbulent times for the credit markets. For example, the schemes were able to generate significant cash from the portfolio holdings, a majority of that from papers rated AA and below.

>3: Reported: The liquidity problem is not related to the Covid-19 pandemic

>Fact: These schemes followed a consistent strategy of investing across the credit rating spectrum and have done so for many years, and across multiple market cycles. The schemes have been able to manage through these cycles and provide daily liquidity. Many of these schemes have been in existence for more than 10 years with a similar strategy. The current Covid-19 pandemic created a severe market dislocation particularly for the types of investments that these schemes hold, though the issue of lack of risk appetite, reduced volumes and illiquidity for corporate bonds was a broader market issue. The inability of the schemes to meet daily redemptions was a direct result of the market situation created by the COVID- 19 pandemic as well as the extended lock-down.

>4: Reported: The schemes will not be able to return investor monies for an extended period of time

>Fact : Each /scheme has its own maturity profile and in general, shorter duration schemes will be able to return monies to investors faster. The schemes will receive regular coupon payments and maturities. In addition, the schemes will explore all opportunities to monetize the underlying assets in the portfolio, without resorting to any distress sales, such that it can return investor monies at the earliest possible time. It will be the endeavor of the schemes to return these monies well in advance of the maturity dates of the underlying securities.

>5: Reported: We should be redeeming our monies from all other Franklin Templeton schemes as these could also be wound up

>Fact : The decision to wind up our suite of six yield-oriented schemes was an extremely difficult one and taken only to protect investor interest. It was not a situation in which we hoped to find ourselves. We also recognize this has impacted liquidity for our investors but was necessary in order to preserve value for our unitholders.

>Our other fixed income schemes which are open for subscription and redemption, primarily invest in highly liquid securities such as Government Securities, AAA rated bonds or other cash and cash equivalents. These portfolios have the necessary ability to generate liquidity in order to meet redemptions. We have already generated a significant amount of liquidity in these portfolios to meet any redemption requests we may receive.

>Our equity schemes remain unaffected and continue to be managed by our experienced and tenured team based in Chennai in line with their investment mandate and fund management philosophy.

>6: Reported: Franklin Templeton is winding up its business in India

>Fact : Franklin Templeton has been an early and patient investor in India. We have worked to build a long-term business in India over our 25+ year history here. This is also reinforced by the fact that over 33% of our global workforce is based in India. As affirmed by our global CEO, Jenny Johnson, Franklin Templeton’s commitment to India remains steadfast. We are committed to doing all we can to return monies in the schemes that are wound up at the earliest to investors, and to regain your trust in our brand.

So the money is actually not lost and Franklin will pay back its investors as and when it sells papers or they mature. Also the [Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)](https://www.amfiindia.com/Themes/Theme1/downloads/AMFIApril242020PressRelease.pdf) in a press release has assured investors that their debt fund investments are safe. The investors will not be able to get their investments back immediately but will get it back over time. The timeline is not clear yet.

Now the real question is where will you keep your money because Debt Funds seemed like the safest mutual funds.

But I do have to work from home so Saturday and Sunday I get time to do something other than work. So Sunday I chose to prepare Momo along with my Wife. I usually don't eat momo's outside but that doesn't prevent us to prepare it at home.

![5ee4c0b2-91ce-4763-9b10-ed84c6f0c8b9.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmSmnGXjZjQpe5X2Ve57UykT853R37sNdXMs7YXVL7xmC7/5ee4c0b2-91ce-4763-9b10-ed84c6f0c8b9.jpg)

Momo is a type of dumpling, which is native to Nepal, Tibet, and neighboring regions. It's basically a wrapping made of flour with a filling inside vegetables. So we have filled the momo with vegetables which had cabbage, carrots, french beans, and onions.

![00f412f1-3eb5-4d50-813d-e28ed53814b5.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmXc1A1nfAVJ4PrA88kLGgnFJfxGm5rqTHa3xCb5dj3Ue1/00f412f1-3eb5-4d50-813d-e28ed53814b5.jpg)

We have fried all the chopped vegetables in the oil along with garlic, soy sauce, black pepper, and salt. For making the outer dough we have used Refined Flour and mixed it with salt and oil. Just like making chapati's we have to knead it to make a firm dough. Then we have made small ball out o the dough as shown below

![8987a9f2-25e5-4351-8ad3-80c5d1d9d554.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWAjJLfuSPKSWxio2rKrTGa18q7XGbzVPDVLHAnTRJoxc/8987a9f2-25e5-4351-8ad3-80c5d1d9d554.jpg)

Then we had rolled each dough ball into a thin circle and filled it with the stuffing prepared earlier. The shape can be anything, we have tried the below shape.

![6ad6e309-25bd-4481-871f-119c5237d57b.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWskyxTEL5PzSKfT4iAxBeM1QMMLMK4SVLqML6DymgTK2/6ad6e309-25bd-4481-871f-119c5237d57b.jpg)

Then we have heat water in a big vessel and let it boil. Once boiled we have added steamer pan and placed the stuffed momo inside it and kept it there for 8-10 minutes. Do check the water at regular intervals, for us the water was very less and we had to pour more water into it.

![e20af509-37e7-49f4-8540-01fbfafcf9b6.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPPFAvT4WcynNN5FCjaR5nCn6E9VHwEerBBmox5sN2X7w/e20af509-37e7-49f4-8540-01fbfafcf9b6.jpg)

We have also prepared tomato chili sauce so served hot steamed momo with the sauce.

1 ) Step to coin conversion rates: Previously for every 1000 outdoor step they were giving 1.25 coins whereas for 1000 indoor steps they were giving 1 coin. Now as every one of us is required to stay indoors and maintain social distancing, they have interchanged the outdoor and indoor steps.

Now 1000 Indoor steps will give you 1.25 coins whereas 1000 outdoor steps will give you 1 coin.

2 ) They have also introduced turbo times where you can earn 1.5 coins for every 1000 steps. Each day there will be 5 time periods of 15 minutes each where your steps will be rewarded extra. Those times are: 7 am to 7:15 am, 10 am to 10:15 am, 1:30 pm to 1:45 pm,  6 pm to 6:15 pm and 10 pm to 10:15 pm. 

3 ) Levels become easier: Previously you need to maintain your level for 3 days otherwise you will be downgraded, if you achieve the highest coins of your level for 3 days you will be upgraded. But they have changed, now you need o to achieve the highest coins for our level for 2 days to leveled up whereas you need to maintain your level for 4 days otherwise you will be leveled down.

Why I really like this app is not about the coins mainly but because you can actually compete with your friends to see who can walk more in a week thus a sense of competition also helps the cause of keeping users motivated. Though rewarding exercise is not common nowadays, there are a lot of apps or apps which reward you for your daily activity. Our own Actifit is one such example, the only reason for not using it that I have to write my daily activities which looks repetitive for me.

>1 - Reviewing my expenditure and planning a budget - I am looking at all the money I have on my savings account, Fixed Deposit and Debt Mutual Fund, and keeping it secure for the uncertain future. I am also looking into my expenses and trying to cut down on it as much as possible. Since I am at home, I don't need a mobile internet connection since I have Wifi at home. I have one big expense that is Home Loan which I cannot defer, so I am budgeting. My Savings - Home loan amount = Total Cash in Hand

>2 - Look for Alternative Income Source - Since we have Hive and Steem, I will try to be more active on the platform just to get the money flowing as a passive income, using that I can sustain my self for some time. Also, I try to create a portfolio for any part-time work in the future.

Now, this is the ways to secure money during Corona Pandemic, but what after that. After everything is normal, we should not spend money which we saved now. Then what should we do then, I am going to list down some of the things which I thought would be better to save some money.

1. I Will not keep all my money in a single asset: Though this is not a way to save money this is definitely a way to secure your money. If you are investing in crypto, good but don't invest everything here. Might be you want to diversify it, keep some in the bank, some as FD, some as a retirement surplus, some in equities, some in Mutual Funds. This is because if you have any emergencies then you can use some liquid funds instead of taking money from your retirement corpus. Same goes with the bank, if you have a savings account please don't put all your funds into a single bank. Have at least 2-3 bank accounts so even if one of your banks goes bankrupt you have other banks where your money is safe.

2. I will calculate my salary after deducting my savings: Say for instance I get $1000 per month, so I will calculate my salary as $800 only and I have to be strict to use only $800 for the whole month, and $200 goes directly to my savings. This way you don't go over your budget and still, you have money left with you. And this is very necessary for times like this. 

3. I will not buy an expensive car or home: This pandemic has shown us that nothing is permanent so why waste your money on show off. You should buy a good car with basic features and with very good security features instead of buying Lamborgini :p. Similarly for home, I am good to stay at rented apartments rather than buying a home. I can see the fear on the people's faces who pay a huge Home loan EMI in this pandemic because they fear losing jobs as well as not able to pay those EMI's.

4. Buying groceries a month: Yes this sounds a little cliche, but I will try to stick with it. Say you go for groceries once a month, then you will only buy which is necessary for the month instead of on wasting money on impulse purchases every time you visit the supermarket. Whenever I go to the supermarket, I do buy a packet of chips, so if I am going once a month that means only one packet of chips I will be buying but if I am going regularly then I will be wasting money on buying chips and chips is not good for health too.

5. Buying a quality product: Now you can say how you are saving money here because quality product usually costs more. Yes, that's true quality products do costs more but they stay with you for years whereas cheap one stays with you for months. I used to buy new shoes every 6 months to 1 year, but instead, I have bought Woodland shoes which is roughly 4 times the money I pay for normal shoes. The woodland shoe is still in working condition after year an half and I guess it will be like this until 2 more years. An increase in the cost of 20% will save you 200% in the future.

6. Live a peaceful and stressful life- Now you may ask how come leaving a peaceful and stressful life will help you save money, yes these can help you big time if you sincerely want to save money because firstly you don't have to waste money on doctors as well as you will not spend money on show-off, you are at peace with whatever you have.

Do you think I have missed any point, do let me know.</p></section></article><article><header><h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4375rem"><a style="box-shadow:none" href="/hive-blog/food-photography-samosa">Food Photography - Samosa</a></h3><small>April 23, 2020</small></header><section><img class="img-body" srcSet="https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/auvkMfBD-20200422_145002-01.jpeg" alt="food-photography-samosa"/><p class="hive-body">#### Another day, preparing another common food. 
<hr>

So today we thought of making Samosa which is very similar to a curry puff. In India, mostly you will get Vegetarian samosa which is filled with potato, Peas, Onion, Spices, Green chili, Cheese, etc. It's a very common tea time snack out here. It can be of different forms, like triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, usually, in India, you will get it in a triangular form which we have tried at home.

We do not have to go out to get anything special for this dish, you can prepare it with everything you have at home.

The below picture is before deep-frying it. The upper coating is of Maida (Refined Wheat Flour) whereas the fillings are of Potato, Onion, Peas, Spices, etc.

The below picture is after deep frying it and served hot with Green Chili and Tomato Sauce.

The recipe which we have referred to is, though we have given our own touch based on the available ingredients.

My wife is one of them, she likes Gol Gappa a lot and she goes out every week to have it in the nearby shop. Since the lockdown, its been 1 month and she hasn't tasted it. So being a good and understanding husband, I have got all the ingredients to make the Gol Gappe at home and it turns out to be a good experiment. Though the taste of homemade Puchka was not that great, but still its much more Hydenic than the street one.  We have also learned a lot of things while preparing and will try again in a week's time.

The Gol Gappe has several names like Pani Puri, Phuchka, Paani ke Patashe, Pakodi, Paani Batashe, Gup Chup, Phulki, Tikki, etc but all tastes the same.

By the way, Gol Gappe does not have an English name but I can summarize it as Crisp spherical pockets of wheat flour filled with chickpeas, boiled potato, and Indian condiments. It is usually eaten with spiced tamarind water.

There are no new opportunities, less profit resulting in Job Loss, low income, furloughs, etc. Those who are in the job, fear about their job losses in the future. ‘Money security’ is an important factor because of the uncertainty because no one knows when the market and economy will recover.

So done something creative with the food too today. Creativity is nothing where you start drawing or paint, but creativity also comes out from a Chef where he brings all his creativity to bring the best out of the ingredients to make something worth while.

**Tried Stuffed Idli**

Yes you heard it right. You all might have eaten idly if you would have been India especially south India where it's very common breakfast. Now you might have eaten the idly in the simple form or in the Rava form were the batter is provided with all the ingredients. But today we have tried Potato Stuffed Idli just like Aloo Paratha and it turns out to be a great experiment. This a mix and match of North Indian Aloo Paratha and South Indian Idly.

![ezv0ie.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/ezv0ie.jpg)

**Sprouts with Idly**

Now again in the evening tried something which is not too common. Sprouts is healthy and I try to eat it everyday in evening. We had some Idly left in the morning so thought of adding it along with some veggies like Potato, Tomato and Onion. So not only it was a healthy snacks but a chat pata chaat which we were carving since the lockdown.

![pqakg4.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/pqakg4.jpg)

So have you tried something which is a mix and match and which come to be a great experiment. If not then this is the time to bring out your creativity. Though I know, now we all should try to keep our creativity to that extent where we don't have to waste too much of our food. </p></section></article><ul style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;align-items:center;list-style:none;padding:0"><a rel="prev" href="/hive-blog/">← Previous Page</a><li style="margin:0">2</li><a rel="next" href="/hive-blog/3">Next Page →</a></ul></main><footer>© <!-- -->2020<!-- -->, Built with<!-- --> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a></footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/2";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-4ba0cd539c0b1449c06b.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-4b1a5a3eb51f56bf97fc.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-97180bb2389bd7dfb0b3.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-list-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-list-js-1af1632b4493347fce8c.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-930e32a97192772af47a.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/hive-blog/component---src-templates-blog-list-js-1af1632b4493347fce8c.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/505b62317f0ce1886a0f4b7cd0ebf6019d251f61-29751227bf5f88a24c2b.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/f3816973199c012e27989b9a598b99c17169a26b-7045b3f99c31a70f519b.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/app-4ba0cd539c0b1449c06b.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/styles-2220f06e9922732c3dfb.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/framework-972833c791692296cdd7.js" async=""></script><script src="/hive-blog/webpack-runtime-f68bcf4dc2772edf1618.js" async=""></script></body></html>
