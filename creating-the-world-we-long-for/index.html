1600 - Steem&#x27;s popularity is skyrocketing! Join now and profit! Seriously! And for everyone else already on Steem, let&#x27;s boost this growing popularity even more. 

This post is about how to create the world we long for and how Steem and other cryptocurrencies can play a big part in this, why we should all try to boost Steem&#x27;s growth with each of our posts as well as ways to incentivize such sharing so it becomes part of Steemians&#x27; second nature.     

Most people who could benefit from using Steem haven&#x27;t heard about it yet and it&#x27;s a no-brainer for everyone  to work toward a better world helping remediate to this.  

## Steem Pays Its Users! ##

Steem is a revolutionary social network which pays its users for the votes, posts and comments they make depending on the votes they received. Not all votes are equal. 

I&#x27;ve made a lot of money Steeming in the last year, more than a hundred thousand dollars, but there&#x27;s possibly very few people who can still expect to make many thousands solely blogging nowadays. 

Steem is the name of the technology and data base on which Steemit runs. Steemit is only one of the the many projects using this data base. [Busy.org](https://busy.org/) is another example, displaying the same information but differently. 

Steem is also the name of the currency users are being paid with. Each Steem are currently worth around [1,40$](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets) and can easily be exchange for money. Steem is currently distributing around 63,000 Steem daily.

No credit card is required ever. The only thing needed to register is a valid email account. 

Steem details of its functionings can be found [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@teamsteem/steem-an-in-depth-overview).

## The Opportunity Of A Lifetime! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/20/27/sunrise-165094_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We&#x27;re still very early and the opportunity to make interesting profits are very real. Steem currently has a bit more than 263,000 accounts.

It&#x27;s somewhat getting increasingly harder to succeed but any success is also increasingly more rewarding as we go. 

Any posts or comments can pay their authors from mere pennies to hundreds of dollars and even though the trending page is filled with posts making hundreds of dollars, no new authors should expect their posts to make this much money even though it remains a possibility. 

Most trending posts are from established authors holding a lot of Steem and thus having a lot to lose or gain from the Steem price performance. Also, people holding a lot of Steem are leveraging them to receive more votes and thus bigger rewards. 

Posting anything will get their authors some rewards, from not quite a penny to much larger rewards as mention above. Posts can be a simple link or image or more extensive post. 

New authors should probably stick to short posts requiring small amount of work and which are fun and witty, that is unless they know how to make their posts being paid well or if they are writing those posts with a precise objective which suits them. 

## Steem Popularity Is Skyrocketing! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2010/12/01/space-shuttle-774_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
Steem is the most fun social network and its meteoric growth is a testament to that.

Steem steemed from concept to reality in early 2016, to become the [3,673](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/steemit.com) most visiting website today and is still going up the rank at a frantic pace. 

Cryptocurrencies are changing the way money is created, distributed and transacted and now Steem also change the way information is disseminated. Money &quot;rule&quot; the world and money creation rules money but that&#x27;s a topic for another post. 

Every 3 seconds new Steem are created and distributed by a network of computers which no single entity control. 

If steemit.com were to close every Steemians would still have control of their funds and they could still access their exact same blog through other site like [busy.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6_DriJbVAhXDuhQKHcPRCzoQFggmMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusy.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRaFK-QAtRGOkZjASdIcd9PQ4FoA) or app like [eSteem](https://steemit.com/esteem/@good-karma/esteem-frequently-asked-questions-faq-eys44lmimx).

## Hundreds Are Joining Everyday!

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/13/08/02/shaking-hands-2499612_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hundreds of people are already joining Steem everyday, sometimes thousands and in a few months it could be tens of thousands. 

I know a lot of us wished we were making and publishing video when Youtube got launched back in early 2005. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of competition back then and this would have been a good opportunity to build a valuable and fun business. 

The same can be said about Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. People with a lot of followers on these websites are receiving advertising offers and some of them are getting well paid to post simple advertising links. 

Steem present even bigger opportunities than these websites and is still in its very early days. 

Joining emerging social networks very early can be very rewarding and Steem is no exception.  

## Our Thoughts And Actions&#x27; Purpose ##

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/08/22/26/meditation-2214532_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The very purpose of our thoughts and actions should be to create the world we long for and for this to happen, it&#x27;s necessary to have our ideas shared by a growing number of people, therein lies the need to share our Steem posts far and wide as much as possible. 

Steem and all its users will gain immensely from accelerating Steem&#x27;s growth. Steem content will get much more diversify, plenty and authors will feed on each others influence of ever more enlightening reflections. 

The real value in each of our lives lie in the joy our actions and knowledge bring us rather than in any sorts of pseudo valuable we own, like national currencies. 

Cooperation amplify our joy while its opposite, abuse, leads to mutual destruction. Let&#x27;s work toward greater cooperation and curtailing abuse whenever possible. 

Our posts should also have a place left open to introduce people to what Steem is and what it can do for them. 

## Creating Beneficial Change! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/22/17/58/clasped-hands-541849_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As I&#x27;ve laid out above, reaching out to people is one of the most important thing in regard to creating the world we long for that&#x27;s why I want to reward those who are doing it. 

My 100% upvote is worth around 70$ and I have 10 of these every 24 hours. I don&#x27;t necessarily plan on giving only 100% upvote but I would love to give at least one a day for the best outreach posts. 

Five days ago I said I would do such a thing for introduction posts. See [here](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me).  It turned out I gave 6 100% votes in a roughly 24 hours period. Here&#x27;s the [list](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me#@teamsteem/re-teamsteem-hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me-20170719t225913791z) of those posts. 

Any posts can be used to promote Steem, even introduction post. I will look for these posts promoting Steem in the tag #promoting-steem. 

None of officially listed tags on Steemit are about promoting Steem. See [here](https://steemit.com/tags). 

## Creating The Culture We Long To Live From! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/02/01/15/orange-tree-1117420_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let&#x27;s create a culture where it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s second nature to share their most useful knowledge and human power. 

Sharing our posts as much as possible should be part of this. Promoting Steem can be easy and can make any already valuable posts even more valuable. 

It&#x27;s easier to create a good post promoting Steem than to make any other type of post.   

## I Made Money On Steemit And So Can You!

There&#x27;s so many people in dire need of money that money can always be used to attract attention but everyone should make sure to be honest though and clearly state that most people won&#x27;t probably make as much money as the earliest adopters. 

Now no matter how much money people will make on average, Steem truly is a revolutionary technology and that&#x27;s one of the reason why I want to share it far and wide as much as possible. I&#x27;ve already shared about all this throughout most of my posts. Here&#x27;s one good [example](https://steemit.com/cooperation/@teamsteem/cooperation-is-humanity-s-greatest-asset). 

By the way, a click-bait title is only a click-bait if the post isn&#x27;t a useful post to the person who clicked on it. A title&#x27;s purpose is to have people click on it and the intent of someone clicking on a link is to have a good time seeing what&#x27;s behind that link. 

## Let&#x27;s Reward Promoting Steem!

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/05/09/13/setting-2473874_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



I will peruse the #promoting-steem tag. I invite others to join too. People should mention approximately how many people they will share their posts with, as well as provide links to these posts from their social media where they shared their posts. 

I use [Bitly.com](https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks) to share my links on other social networks. Bitly allow me to know how many people clicked on my links and also when. 

I have more than 200 clicks from Facebook&#x27;s profile, on one of my [post](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan/posts/10159024444040471) I shared there last week. I also have more than [90 views](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/posts/1172186039593860) on the same post I share on one of my Facebook page. 

Steemit.com receive around [555k page views](http://www.hypestat.com/info/steemit.com) per day and around [14.4k Steem posts](https://steemdata.com/charts) are published every day. If everyone shared their posts and received only 10 clicks on them then that would result in a 25% increase in page views per day. From there, even more could be achieved.     

It&#x27;s a given, Steem&#x27;s already skyrocketing popularity would experience an epic boost if everyone would shared most of their Steem posts to their other social networks and that&#x27;s why we should all make concerting efforts toward this goal.  

# Boosting Steemit&#x27;s Already Existing Buzz! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/19/15/audience-1850119_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each and every time people will hear about Steem should help generate create more interest.  

Tagging friends on Facebook and Twitter as well as adding tag there, will definitely helps your posts get more views.

If a lot of people begin to use the tag #promoting-steem then it might be a good idea to put the number of people the post is going to be shared with in the first line under the title&#x27;s post like I did. 

The number of people being reached out isn&#x27;t the only thing I&#x27;ll be looking in rewarding posts. I&#x27;ll also be looking at the overall quality. 

I encourage everyone to help me incentivize this habit of doing as much as possible to boost Steem&#x27;s growth. 

Whether or not this initiative will do much difference remains to be seen. It might or might not but I felt like trying.

Steem steemed from concept to reality in early 2016, to become the [3,673](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/steemit.com) most visiting website today and is still going up the rank at a frantic pace. 

Cryptocurrencies are changing the way money is created, distributed and transacted and now Steem also change the way information is disseminated. Money &quot;rule&quot; the world and money creation rules money but that&#x27;s a topic for another post. 

Every 3 seconds new Steem are created and distributed by a network of computers which no single entity control. 

If steemit.com were to close every Steemians would still have control of their funds and they could still access their exact same blog through other site like [busy.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE6_DriJbVAhXDuhQKHcPRCzoQFggmMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusy.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRaFK-QAtRGOkZjASdIcd9PQ4FoA) or app like [eSteem](https://steemit.com/esteem/@good-karma/esteem-frequently-asked-questions-faq-eys44lmimx).

## Hundreds Are Joining Everyday!

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/13/08/02/shaking-hands-2499612_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hundreds of people are already joining Steem everyday, sometimes thousands and in a few months it could be tens of thousands. 

I know a lot of us wished we were making and publishing video when Youtube got launched back in early 2005. There wasn&#x27;t a lot of competition back then and this would have been a good opportunity to build a valuable and fun business. 

The same can be said about Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. People with a lot of followers on these websites are receiving advertising offers and some of them are getting well paid to post simple advertising links. 

Steem present even bigger opportunities than these websites and is still in its very early days. 

Joining emerging social networks very early can be very rewarding and Steem is no exception.  

## Our Thoughts And Actions&#x27; Purpose ##

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/08/22/26/meditation-2214532_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The very purpose of our thoughts and actions should be to create the world we long for and for this to happen, it&#x27;s necessary to have our ideas shared by a growing number of people, therein lies the need to share our Steem posts far and wide as much as possible. 

Steem and all its users will gain immensely from accelerating Steem&#x27;s growth. Steem content will get much more diversify, plenty and authors will feed on each others influence of ever more enlightening reflections. 

The real value in each of our lives lie in the joy our actions and knowledge bring us rather than in any sorts of pseudo valuable we own, like national currencies. 

Cooperation amplify our joy while its opposite, abuse, leads to mutual destruction. Let&#x27;s work toward greater cooperation and curtailing abuse whenever possible. 

Our posts should also have a place left open to introduce people to what Steem is and what it can do for them. 

## Creating Beneficial Change! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/22/17/58/clasped-hands-541849_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As I&#x27;ve laid out above, reaching out to people is one of the most important thing in regard to creating the world we long for that&#x27;s why I want to reward those who are doing it. 

My 100% upvote is worth around 70$ and I have 10 of these every 24 hours. I don&#x27;t necessarily plan on giving only 100% upvote but I would love to give at least one a day for the best outreach posts. 

Five days ago I said I would do such a thing for introduction posts. See [here](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me).  It turned out I gave 6 100% votes in a roughly 24 hours period. Here&#x27;s the [list](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me#@teamsteem/re-teamsteem-hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me-20170719t225913791z) of those posts. 

Any posts can be used to promote Steem, even introduction post. I will look for these posts promoting Steem in the tag #promoting-steem. 

None of officially listed tags on Steemit are about promoting Steem. See [here](https://steemit.com/tags). 

## Creating The Culture We Long To Live From! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/02/01/15/orange-tree-1117420_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let&#x27;s create a culture where it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s second nature to share their most useful knowledge and human power. 

Sharing our posts as much as possible should be part of this. Promoting Steem can be easy and can make any already valuable posts even more valuable. 

It&#x27;s easier to create a good post promoting Steem than to make any other type of post.   

## I Made Money On Steemit And So Can You!

There&#x27;s so many people in dire need of money that money can always be used to attract attention but everyone should make sure to be honest though and clearly state that most people won&#x27;t probably make as much money as the earliest adopters. 

Now no matter how much money people will make on average, Steem truly is a revolutionary technology and that&#x27;s one of the reason why I want to share it far and wide as much as possible. I&#x27;ve already shared about all this throughout most of my posts. Here&#x27;s one good [example](https://steemit.com/cooperation/@teamsteem/cooperation-is-humanity-s-greatest-asset). 

By the way, a click-bait title is only a click-bait if the post isn&#x27;t a useful post to the person who clicked on it. A title&#x27;s purpose is to have people click on it and the intent of someone clicking on a link is to have a good time seeing what&#x27;s behind that link. 

## Let&#x27;s Reward Promoting Steem!

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/05/09/13/setting-2473874_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



I will peruse the #promoting-steem tag. I invite others to join too. People should mention approximately how many people they will share their posts with, as well as provide links to these posts from their social media where they shared their posts. 

I use [Bitly.com](https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks) to share my links on other social networks. Bitly allow me to know how many people clicked on my links and also when. 

I have more than 200 clicks from Facebook&#x27;s profile, on one of my [post](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan/posts/10159024444040471) I shared there last week. I also have more than [90 views](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/posts/1172186039593860) on the same post I share on one of my Facebook page. 

Steemit.com receive around [555k page views](http://www.hypestat.com/info/steemit.com) per day and around [14.4k Steem posts](https://steemdata.com/charts) are published every day. If everyone shared their posts and received only 10 clicks on them then that would result in a 25% increase in page views per day. From there, even more could be achieved.     

It&#x27;s a given, Steem&#x27;s already skyrocketing popularity would experience an epic boost if everyone would shared most of their Steem posts to their other social networks and that&#x27;s why we should all make concerting efforts toward this goal.  

# Boosting Steemit&#x27;s Already Existing Buzz! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/19/15/audience-1850119_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each and every time people will hear about Steem should help generate create more interest.  

Tagging friends on Facebook and Twitter as well as adding tag there, will definitely helps your posts get more views.

If a lot of people begin to use the tag #promoting-steem then it might be a good idea to put the number of people the post is going to be shared with in the first line under the title&#x27;s post like I did. 

The number of people being reached out isn&#x27;t the only thing I&#x27;ll be looking in rewarding posts. I&#x27;ll also be looking at the overall quality. 

I encourage everyone to help me incentivize this habit of doing as much as possible to boost Steem&#x27;s growth. 

Whether or not this initiative will do much difference remains to be seen. It might or might not but I felt like trying.

1600 - Steem&#x27;s popularity is skyrocketing! Join now and profit! Seriously! And for everyone else already on Steem, let&#x27;s boost this growing popularity even more. 

This post is about how to create the world we long for and how Steem and other cryptocurrencies can play a big part in this, why we should all try to boost Steem&#x27;s growth with each of our posts as well as ways to incentivize such sharing so it becomes part of Steemians&#x27; second nature.     

Most people who could benefit from using Steem haven&#x27;t heard about it yet and it&#x27;s a no-brainer for everyone  to work toward a better world helping remediate to this.  

## Steem Pays Its Users! ##

Steem is a revolutionary social network which pays its users for the votes, posts and comments they make depending on the votes they received. Not all votes are equal. 

I&#x27;ve made a lot of money Steeming in the last year, more than a hundred thousand dollars, but there&#x27;s possibly very few people who can still expect to make many thousands solely blogging nowadays. 

Steem is the name of the technology and data base on which Steemit runs. Steemit is only one of the the many projects using this data base. [Busy.org](https://busy.org/) is another example, displaying the same information but differently. 

Steem is also the name of the currency users are being paid with. Each Steem are currently worth around [1,40$](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets) and can easily be exchange for money. Steem is currently distributing around 63,000 Steem daily.

No credit card is required ever. The only thing needed to register is a valid email account. 

Steem details of its functionings can be found [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@teamsteem/steem-an-in-depth-overview).

## The Opportunity Of A Lifetime! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/20/27/sunrise-165094_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We&#x27;re still very early and the opportunity to make interesting profits are very real. Steem currently has a bit more than 263,000 accounts.

It&#x27;s somewhat getting increasingly harder to succeed but any success is also increasingly more rewarding as we go. 

Any posts or comments can pay their authors from mere pennies to hundreds of dollars and even though the trending page is filled with posts making hundreds of dollars, no new authors should expect their posts to make this much money even though it remains a possibility. 

Most trending posts are from established authors holding a lot of Steem and thus having a lot to lose or gain from the Steem price performance. Also, people holding a lot of Steem are leveraging them to receive more votes and thus bigger rewards. 

Posting anything will get their authors some rewards, from not quite a penny to much larger rewards as mention above. Posts can be a simple link or image or more extensive post. 

New authors should probably stick to short posts requiring small amount of work and which are fun and witty, that is unless they know how to make their posts being paid well or if they are writing those posts with a precise objective which suits them.

I have more than 200 clicks from Facebook&#x27;s profile, on one of my [post](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan/posts/10159024444040471) I shared there last week. I also have more than [90 views](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/posts/1172186039593860) on the same post I share on one of my Facebook page. 

Steemit.com receive around [555k page views](http://www.hypestat.com/info/steemit.com) per day and around [14.4k Steem posts](https://steemdata.com/charts) are published every day. If everyone shared their posts and received only 10 clicks on them then that would result in a 25% increase in page views per day. From there, even more could be achieved.     

It&#x27;s a given, Steem&#x27;s already skyrocketing popularity would experience an epic boost if everyone would shared most of their Steem posts to their other social networks and that&#x27;s why we should all make concerting efforts toward this goal.  

# Boosting Steemit&#x27;s Already Existing Buzz! 

&lt;div class=&quot;pull-left&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/19/15/audience-1850119_960_720.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each and every time people will hear about Steem should help generate create more interest.  

Tagging friends on Facebook and Twitter as well as adding tag there, will definitely helps your posts get more views.

If a lot of people begin to use the tag #promoting-steem then it might be a good idea to put the number of people the post is going to be shared with in the first line under the title&#x27;s post like I did. 

The number of people being reached out isn&#x27;t the only thing I&#x27;ll be looking in rewarding posts. I&#x27;ll also be looking at the overall quality. 

I encourage everyone to help me incentivize this habit of doing as much as possible to boost Steem&#x27;s growth. 

Whether or not this initiative will do much difference remains to be seen. It might or might not but I felt like trying.

<p>1600 - Steem's popularity is skyrocketing! Join now and profit! Seriously! And for everyone else already on Steem, let's boost this growing popularity even more. </p>
<p>This post is about how to create the world we long for and how Steem and other cryptocurrencies can play a big part in this, why we should all try to boost Steem's growth with each of our posts as well as ways to incentivize such sharing so it becomes part of Steemians' second nature.     </p>
<p>Most people who could benefit from using Steem haven't heard about it yet and it's a no-brainer for everyone  to work toward a better world helping remediate to this.  </p>
<h2 id="steem-pays-its-users">Steem Pays Its Users!</h2>
<p>Steem is a revolutionary social network which pays its users for the votes, posts and comments they make depending on the votes they received. Not all votes are equal. </p>
<p>I've made a lot of money Steeming in the last year, more than a hundred thousand dollars, but there's possibly very few people who can still expect to make many thousands solely blogging nowadays. </p>
<p>Steem is the name of the technology and data base on which Steemit runs. Steemit is only one of the the many projects using this data base. <a href="https://busy.org/">Busy.org</a> is another example, displaying the same information but differently. </p>
<p>Steem is also the name of the currency users are being paid with. Each Steem are currently worth around <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets">1,40$</a> and can easily be exchange for money. Steem is currently distributing around 63,000 Steem daily.</p>
<p>No credit card is required ever. The only thing needed to register is a valid email account. </p>
<p>Steem details of its functionings can be found <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/@teamsteem/steem-an-in-depth-overview">here</a>. </p>

<div class="pull-right"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/20/27/sunrise-165094_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>We're still very early and the opportunity to make interesting profits are very real. Steem currently has a bit more than 263,000 accounts.</p>
<p>It's somewhat getting increasingly harder to succeed but any success is also increasingly more rewarding as we go. </p>
<p>Any posts or comments can pay their authors from mere pennies to hundreds of dollars and even though the trending page is filled with posts making hundreds of dollars, no new authors should expect their posts to make this much money even though it remains a possibility. </p>
<p>Most trending posts are from established authors holding a lot of Steem and thus having a lot to lose or gain from the Steem price performance. Also, people holding a lot of Steem are leveraging them to receive more votes and thus bigger rewards. </p>
<p>Posting anything will get their authors some rewards, from not quite a penny to much larger rewards as mention above. Posts can be a simple link or image or more extensive post. </p>
<p>New authors should probably stick to short posts requiring small amount of work and which are fun and witty, that is unless they know how to make their posts being paid well or if they are writing those posts with a precise objective which suits them. </p>
<h2 id="steem-popularity-is-skyrocketing">Steem Popularity Is Skyrocketing!</h2>
<div class="pull-left"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2010/12/01/space-shuttle-774_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>Steem is the most fun social network and its meteoric growth is a testament to that.</p>
<p>Steem steemed from concept to reality in early 2016, to become the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/steemit.com">3,673</a> most visiting website today and is still going up the rank at a frantic pace. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are changing the way money is created, distributed and transacted and now Steem also change the way information is disseminated. Money "rule" the world and money creation rules money but that's a topic for another post. </p>
<p>Every 3 seconds new Steem are created and distributed by a network of computers which no single entity control. </p>
<p>If steemit.com were to close every Steemians would still have control of their funds and they could still access their exact same blog through other site like <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiE6_DriJbVAhXDuhQKHcPRCzoQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusy.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNHRaFK-QAtRGOkZjASdIcd9PQ4FoA">busy.org</a> or app like <a href="https://steemit.com/esteem/@good-karma/esteem-frequently-asked-questions-faq-eys44lmimx">eSteem</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hundreds-are-joining-everyday">Hundreds Are Joining Everyday!</h2>
<div class="pull-right"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/13/08/02/shaking-hands-2499612_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>Hundreds of people are already joining Steem everyday, sometimes thousands and in a few months it could be tens of thousands. </p>
<p>I know a lot of us wished we were making and publishing video when Youtube got launched back in early 2005. There wasn't a lot of competition back then and this would have been a good opportunity to build a valuable and fun business. </p>
<p>The same can be said about Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. People with a lot of followers on these websites are receiving advertising offers and some of them are getting well paid to post simple advertising links. </p>
<p>Steem present even bigger opportunities than these websites and is still in its very early days. </p>
<p>Joining emerging social networks very early can be very rewarding and Steem is no exception.  </p>
<h2 id="our-thoughts-and-actions-purpose">Our Thoughts And Actions' Purpose</h2>
<div class="pull-left"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/08/22/26/meditation-2214532_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>The very purpose of our thoughts and actions should be to create the world we long for and for this to happen, it's necessary to have our ideas shared by a growing number of people, therein lies the need to share our Steem posts far and wide as much as possible. </p>
<p>Steem and all its users will gain immensely from accelerating Steem's growth. Steem content will get much more diversify, plenty and authors will feed on each others influence of ever more enlightening reflections. </p>
<p>The real value in each of our lives lie in the joy our actions and knowledge bring us rather than in any sorts of pseudo valuable we own, like national currencies. </p>
<p>Cooperation amplify our joy while its opposite, abuse, leads to mutual destruction. Let's work toward greater cooperation and curtailing abuse whenever possible. </p>
<p>Our posts should also have a place left open to introduce people to what Steem is and what it can do for them. </p>
<h2 id="creating-beneficial-change">Creating Beneficial Change!</h2>
<div class="pull-right"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/22/17/58/clasped-hands-541849_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>As I've laid out above, reaching out to people is one of the most important thing in regard to creating the world we long for that's why I want to reward those who are doing it. </p>
<p>My 100% upvote is worth around 70$ and I have 10 of these every 24 hours. I don't necessarily plan on giving only 100% upvote but I would love to give at least one a day for the best outreach posts. </p>
<p>Five days ago I said I would do such a thing for introduction posts. See <a href="https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me">here</a>.  It turned out I gave 6 100% votes in a roughly 24 hours period. Here's the <a href="https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me#@teamsteem/re-teamsteem-hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me-20170719t225913791z">list</a> of those posts. </p>
<p>Any posts can be used to promote Steem, even introduction post. I will look for these posts promoting Steem in the tag #promoting-steem. </p>
<p>None of officially listed tags on Steemit are about promoting Steem. See <a href="https://steemit.com/tags">here</a>. </p>

<div class="pull-left"><center><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/02/01/15/orange-tree-1117420_960_720.jpg" /><br/><em></div>
<p>Let's create a culture where it's in everyone's second nature to share their most useful knowledge and human power. </p>
<p>Sharing our posts as much as possible should be part of this. Promoting Steem can be easy and can make any already valuable posts even more valuable. </p>
<p>It's easier to create a good post promoting Steem than to make any other type of post.   </p>
<h2 id="i-made-money-on-steemit-and-so-can-you">I Made Money On Steemit And So Can You!</h2>
<p>There's so many people in dire need of money that money can always be used to attract attention but everyone should make sure to be honest though and clearly state that most people won't probably make as much money as the earliest adopters. </p>
<p>Now no matter how much money people will make on average, Steem truly is a revolutionary technology and that's one of the reason why I want to share it far and wide as much as possible. I've already shared about all this throughout most of my posts. Here's one good <a href="https://steemit.com/cooperation/@teamsteem/cooperation-is-humanity-s-greatest-asset">example</a>. </p>
<p>By the way, a click-bait title is only a click-bait if the post isn't a useful post to the person who clicked on it. A title's purpose is to have people click on it and the intent of someone clicking on a link is to have a good time seeing what's behind that link. </p>
