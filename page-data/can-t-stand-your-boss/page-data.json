Why is it that some humans think they are better then others?  This is life I suppose.   One boss I am dealing with seems to like to scream and belittle me when she thinks I do something wrong. This has happened a few times, and its really getting old.   She plays a nice roll in front of others but then exerts this \"you will do this\" mentality all the time.  It seems like everytime I turn around she is there.  Getting tired.  I am really considering taking my own advise and quiting my job.  Life really is to short to be living under an oppression.  Looking to take the \"leap of faith\" soon.  I just hope I have the courage to follow through. \n![boss2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYPxmxDnBhMsHgtuBt8CHFVczyZEmw1wt8BCvU23fUWQB/boss2.jpg)\n\n\nLiving overseas doesn't help matters either.  Raising 3 children in a culture that is not their own, learning a new language, customs, etc. I sure would like to be living back in the States.  I think what is really going on is that the stress load is just to great for me here.  A boss that hovers over me sure doesn't help matters.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts?  Does anyone have a Boss that they just are having problems with?   Good Luck and Hang in their STEEMIANS.  Cheers.","created":"July 25, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Can't Stand Your BOSS?","permlink":"can-t-stand-your-boss","previous":{"title":"Afternoon Yawning","permlink":"afternoon-yawning"},"next":{"title":"White Peocock - Bannerghatta National Park, India","permlink":"white-peocock-bannerghatta-national-park-india"}}}}
