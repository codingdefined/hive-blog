Now a simple question to each and everyone out there that are you living in Sync with the nature? According to Speakingtree, living in sync with nature simply means respecting the earth, other species who are living on earth as well as the environment you are living in. If you or anyone is not respecting the nature than it will be a doomsday for us.\n\nThough the article is apt owing to the current scenario where we are cutting down the forests in the name of development. Though development is needed but not on the sake of creating imbalance on the environment. Cutting down forests not only ncreases the global warning but also is bad for the environment as it is home for so many animals. We are heading to that day where only man will be living on earth with some oxygen cylinder on their back and no one else. \n\n<center><a title=\"By Rkantckd [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], from Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plant_tree.png\"><img width=\"128\" alt=\"Plant tree\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Plant_tree.png\"></a></center>\n\nSo please plant atleast a tree on your birthday, just as others planted for you you should plant for the sake of your children. We do cut a cake every year to celebrate our birthday so why not plant at least one tree every year and make a practice for the whole family. This way you are not only helping the environment but also educating your child the importance of environment. \n\nWe have seen so many extinction of animals, what do you thing is the cause. The main cause of extinction is the environment imbalance and the animals who cannot stand it got extinct. Do you want your childs to see Tigers and Lions in the book and not in the zoo.","created":"July 04, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Are you living in Sync with Nature?","permlink":"are-you-living-in-sync-with-nature","previous":{"title":"Thank you all Witnesses","permlink":"thank-you-all-witnesses-3a8eed432ef05"},"next":{"title":"One Month of Riding Experience of Suzuki Gixxer","permlink":"one-month-of-riding-experience-of-suzuki-gixxer"}}}}
