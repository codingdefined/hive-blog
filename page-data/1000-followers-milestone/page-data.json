Its been 3 months after that post and I reached 1000 followers milestone. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmREcczJ4Ab5st6UHTcZo13YgUHRPn2CpVBfGYY1ESxqMm/image.png)\n\nIt always good to record your milestone because it will give you the sense of work you are doing in the awesome platform also it will help you to achieve more i.e. you can target your own milestone. When I have posted about the last milestone my next milestone was 60 Reputation and 1000 followers and I got the reputation but not the followers so I waited for this to complete before posting.\n\nIt changed a lot in these 3 months here in Steemit personally. I became Utopian.io Moderator and also working on some of the cool apps to help the big community in every small possible way I can.","created":"January 25, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"1000 Followers Milestone","permlink":"1000-followers-milestone","previous":{"title":"Camel Ride on the Beach","permlink":"camel-ride-on-the-beach"},"next":{"title":"Happy Republic Day to All Indians","permlink":"happy-republic-day-to-all-indians"}}}}
