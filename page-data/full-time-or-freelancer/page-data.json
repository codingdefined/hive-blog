This is the same for a lot of employees who work full time because they want to be their own boss but again if you ask many freelancers, they say they want stability and security like full-time salaried employees.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmUXpTcDLZn5mPP3DoKyFEEKfKrpiFoT58Mzuzx1sMdAU1/image.png)\nPC: Pexels.com\n\nThe grass may look greener on the other side whichever side you are in. Full-time employees have stability with them along with the security from the employers to some extent, a timely working schedule as well as timely payment. The problem with freelancers is that they don't have a fixed income, they are not paid on a daily basis (most of them), and there is no guarantee that they will have work next week or if they will get paid the next week. But the good thing with freelancers is that they have the freedom to work from anywhere and everywhere. They don't have to travel, can have work from home always, they are paid hourly and get paid in whatever hours they work for.\n\nAlong with this, the advantage I feel Full-Time employees have is that they get benefits like health insurance, paid vacations, sick leaves, and a retirement scheme.\n\nThe question is what you would like to become given a choice and why?","created":"May 02, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Full Time or Freelancer?","permlink":"full-time-or-freelancer","previous":{"title":"How you would have tackled Covid-19?","permlink":"how-you-would-have-tackled-covid-19"},"next":{"title":"Is Artificial Intelligence better than Human Intelligence?","permlink":"is-artificial-intelligence-better-than-human-intelligence"}}}}
