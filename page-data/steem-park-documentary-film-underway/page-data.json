To ensure this, we've partnered with [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/) (an award winning New York City based film company)**\n\n# A Journey Worth Documenting\n---\n\nLast week, we were super excited to [announce Steemit Inc's official support of Steem Park!](https://steemit.com/steempark/@hitheryon/steem-park-is-official-steemit-s-first-crowdsourced-marketing-project) It has been an incredible few months developing this project and the support we received from the community has been overwhelming. So before we start this post, we want to send out another resounding THANK YOU!\n\nWhen we, @voronoi and @hansikhouse, first started collaborating again on a joint Steemit account, we had big dreams of what Steemit could do for the design community from the beginning. Steemit, blockchain, and the development of social-media equity could completely transform how we make things, especially in regards to the public like parks, waterfronts, playgrounds, and so on. STEEM Park will not only be an opportunity to showcase Steemit and build a fun park, *it will be the world's first public-interest project funded by public-interest.*\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmNS4CgFzB9ZZ9i8Wk14HvLhWD15FfnzoCHySYquzgLqV2/Pop-Up_Garden_Final-Gif.gif\n\nThat's why this project is such an incredible thing for us. It is an opportunity to revolutionize a profession that has historically relied on deep private-interest pockets. STEEM Park is a journey to prove that blockchain technology can be the new economic foundation for how we make this world.\n\nThere was no way that we would limit this ambition to just a month's worth of posts. We wanted to make a stand and show the world that Steemit is a powerful new force to be reckoned with and had the potential to shake up content-production industries around the world. So we came up with an idea...\n\n# A Film Showcasing Steemit's Generative Power\n\n---\n\nA couple weeks ago, we met with the founding directors of [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/), New York City's premiere filmmakers for process-based work and development. After an extensive conversation about Steemit and STEEM Park, we collectively decided that a film would be the best way to showcase this effort.\n\nWe're super pumped about having The Timelapse Group onboard for this. They're an award winning company with a portfolio ranging from several Forbes 500 companies to Vimeo Staff Picks and an array of other accolades. These guys are legit and are already on their way of forwarding that talent into STEEM Park!\n\n<center>*Sneak peak...
