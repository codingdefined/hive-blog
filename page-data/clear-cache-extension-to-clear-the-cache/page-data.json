So sometimes you might have heard people say that please clear the cache, what does that mean is to remove that memory so that fresh web pages would be downloaded from the web.\n\nFor Example, you are working on some web page and that web page was edited recently, you might not get the latest changes until you clear the cache. One importance of using the Cache is that browse loads that page too quickly as it stores some data and does not have to download all over again.\n\nTo remove the cache you need to go to Browser settings and do it every time, this is actually a headache for a Front End developers because it wastes so much time. Instead of going there I use simple chrome extension called Clear Cache, which clears the cache for me on one click.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYDZVSY6oFHZotGxFpNL6AJcMk59CvRvntHjghHNtBPPG/image.png)\n\nIt saves a lot of time and you will see near real time web pages and not cache pages.\n\nThis plugin ask you what data you want to remove, so be careful with that I mainly use Cache and App Cache because if you check all the boxes it will remove all the history and passwords which you might have saved in the browser.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTH9BJnsda7ufgTtB23vkGdTBtMnTAL6Rwu8jWpbGX9i6/image.png)","created":"March 05, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Clear Cache Extension to clear the Cache","permlink":"clear-cache-extension-to-clear-the-cache","previous":{"title":"Beautiful Sunday - Cold Coffee at Starbucks to beat the Summer","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-cold-coffee-at-starbucks-to-beat-the-summer"},"next":{"title":"TrueUSD started trading in Bittrex, is it the end of Tether?","permlink":"trueusd-started-trading-in-bittrex-is-it-the-end-of-tether"}}}}
