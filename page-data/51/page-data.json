Motivation is what reasons us to behave, whether or not it is getting a glass of water to lessen thirst or reading an e-book to benefit expertise.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZZPusY2BRtL2ZExhpAYs6S9P2umrfjoDjc82cXJK2ama/image.png)\n\nIn regular usage, the time period motivation is regularly used to explain why someone does some thing. For example, you may say that a scholar is so prompted to get into top college or university that he spends every night time studying.\n\n### What are the things that actually motivate us to act? \n###\n\nInstincts (a natural or innate impulse, inclination, or tendency.) & Drives (to send, expel, or otherwise cause to move by force or compulsion) and Needs (necessity) are three main things which actually motivate us to act. \n\n### Different Types of Motivation\n###\n\nThere are mainly two types of motivation Extrinsic Motivations and Intrinsic Motivation.\n\nExtrinsic motivations are those who arise from outside of the person and often involve rewards consisting of trophies, cash, social popularity or praise. Intrinsic motivations are those who stand up from within the individual, consisting of doing a complicated password puzzle merely for the non-public gratification of solving a hassle.\n\n### Small Story on Motivation\n###\n\nNote : \"This beautiful story came to me via whatsapp but I don't know where it originated\"\n\nA man discovered a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for numerous hours because it struggled to squeeze its body through the tiny hole. Then it stopped as though it couldn‚Äôt move similarly. So the person determined to assist the butterfly. He took a couple of scissors and snipped off the closing bits of cocoon. The butterfly emerged without problems but it had a swollen frame and reduced in size wings.\n\nThe man continued to watch it, expecting that any minute the wings would enlarge and expand enough to support the body, neither happened! In fact the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around. It was never able to fly.\n\n**What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand:** The restricting cocoon and the struggle required by the butterfly to get through the opening was a way of forcing the fluid from the body into the wings so that it would be ready for flight once that was achieved.\n\n### Motto of the story\n###\n\nSometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. Going through life with no obstacles would cripple us. We will not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.\n\nI will conclude my post by saying a great quote by a great scientist ‚ÄúNo matter how good you are at planning, the pressure never goes away. So I don't fight it. I feed off it. I turn pressure into motivation to do my best.\n\nSo again my question remains the same \"Are you motivated?\"","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"blog\",\"writing\",\"motivation\",\"philosophy\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZZPusY2BRtL2ZExhpAYs6S9P2umrfjoDjc82cXJK2ama\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3629ccf9-999b-5ff4-be8d-ce49a3b83ce5","title":"Fancy Grass in Kolkata - A horse made of Grass","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 30, 2017","permlink":"fancy-grass-in-kolkata-a-horse-made-of-grass","body":"Today my friend has shared this image with me.

As of now Bitcoin is over 4000$, and its very difficult to get even 1 Bitcoin (you can get bitcoins even in 1$) but that's not the point. We can see the benefits of using them but we are skeptical that what if it crashes tomorrow.\n\nSo, in this post, I will share one such site which is trusted and its verified by me. Before jumping in let‚Äôs just be clear, there is no shortcut to get wealthy without working or investing for it. Say, in Steemit also you have to work hard day and night to write good posts to see your earnings increase. It is just impossible to make an income in bitcoins or any other currency just by clicking around on some websites.\n\n### Disclaimer: You will not get rich in earning bitcoins, is just that you will get extra bitcoins to play with Cryptos, if you have not started. I am also not posting my referrer id if you think that it is just to get enough referrers.\n###\n\nOne such website is FreeBitcoin (https://freebitco.in), which I am using for the last 1 month. The model of this website is you will earn Satoshis every hour (As of now the satoshis is 44). \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRiwF3ipreo6y3anv7f97Ley46R6qfxU7PMLeb8mkJ1CH/image.png)\n\nYou have to click the Play button and based on the Lucky Number you will get the payments. I have even got 500 satoshis but which is very rare. Once you have played you have to wait 60 minutes until you play again.\n\nThen you have an option to play bet. There is 47.5% chance that you will win the bet. Try to play it on your own risk because you sometimes lose a lot. I have lost more than 8000 satoshis by ignoring the fact. Now I am little more thoughtful.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUufHKsA6wdQhcquJhgsj1fgMhWtr3apnDgJ2EczepZav/image.png)\n\nNow if you have more than 30000 satoshis you will even earn interest(Annual interest 4.08%). I have earned around  150 satoshis in interest.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaksBiSa7SfrjU8tDYRyfp6bLuHiAnsz2KyJpJwKoR46b/image.png)\n\nI will leave other things to be explored by you itself.

As I said it's not huge, but can be tried.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcmxRVrAB5pHHMgXa2wLAQQsnhN843HoEqgqLVmJyVTut/image.png)\n\n### Disclaimer Again:  I am also not posting my referrer id if you think that this post is just to get enough referrers.\n\n### Upvote, Follow, Resteem @codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"bitcoin\",\"cryptocurrency\",\"blockchain\",\"money\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRiwF3ipreo6y3anv7f97Ley46R6qfxU7PMLeb8mkJ1CH\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmUufHKsA6wdQhcquJhgsj1fgMhWtr3apnDgJ2EczepZav\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaksBiSa7SfrjU8tDYRyfp6bLuHiAnsz2KyJpJwKoR46b\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmcmxRVrAB5pHHMgXa2wLAQQsnhN843HoEqgqLVmJyVTut\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/freebitco.in\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"1456b086-989a-5843-889b-0145e4893be8","title":"When it comes in Advertisement, nothing can beat Durex","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 29, 2017","permlink":"when-it-comes-in-advertisement-nothing-can-beat-durex","body":"Have a look at the below advertisement it says \"Dear JON, We Incest you use Protection\".
