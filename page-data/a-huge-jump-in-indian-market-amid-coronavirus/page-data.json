It is the biggest one day jump after May 2009 i.e. after 11 years. Being a small-time investor, it's always a feel-good factor to see your holdings go up. I was mainly investing in Financial and got a big hit last month and my portfolio was down around 30%. Today my portfolio rose around 9%.\n\nThough I am investing in Mutual Funds from the last 3-4 years, I have started the stocks trading or rather investing from this year itself. Along with getting a hit, I am not worried because I know in 3-4 months the market will bounce back and you will see everything in green. All the top investors are saying that you should invest some amount now with a time horizon of 3-4 years after keeping sufficient liquidity for any emergencies.\n\nI basically have 3 stocks as of now in my portfolio, in which HDFC bank has got a big hit. Though I am optimistic that in the future it will give me good returns. I have added few SBI Cards share last Friday because the price seems to be good for long term.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcrL8NiADiqyZG4YyteA8Y3NTJV348R8YD4MA9bkTQPCG/image.png)\n\nAlong with the above stocks, I am keeping my eye on these below stocks and will be getting those as and when I will have some money.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmXXGPbZvqCUzVQt5h6MRuUMRX3mwwtzEJs6zY7KdHZb7C/image.png)","created":"April 07, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Huge Jump in Indian Market amid Coronavirus","permlink":"a-huge-jump-in-indian-market-amid-coronavirus","previous":{"title":"What you should not do in Lockdown","permlink":"what-you-should-not-do-in-lockdown"},"next":{"title":"In Quarantine - Eat Healthy or Eat Right","permlink":"in-quarantine-eat-healthy-or-eat-right"}}}}
