We need to start Social Distancing as well as reducing going out. \n\nAlong with that, our Prime Minister urged everyone that on Sunday we should observe Janta Curfew for 14 hours. It can be done for numerous reasons. Janata Curfew is voluntarily staying indoors by people themselves. The reasons can be to break the chain of spreading the virus, people get feel of how to stay indoors when the situation worsens i.e. mock drill. \n\nIf anyone wants to know about the cases in India or in their state can refer to the website [https://covidout.in/](https://covidout.in/).\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcSSNNDRytoU1YXBATxWttAvo2kKBsQRBqTPfmJfmwgGj/image.png)\nPC : CovidOut\n\nIn my case, I am working from home, from the last week and it will continue for at least 2 weeks.

But they don't understand that the infected person will not know if they are infected with a virus or not.

They even threatened to kill him on Social Media. Instead of blaming him we must remain humane in these difficult times. What we as an Indian or anyone can do is to maintain Social Distancing, this is the only way we can stop the virus.\n\n![](https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/social-distancing.jpg?fit=1024%2C561)\nPC : CalMatters.org\n\nDoctors said that not everyone has to wear a mask, but I would suggest wearing a handkerchief at least and wash it every day with Dettol or any disinfectant, this is just a way to protect yourself and your family.

But today there was a feature added to the app which I guess takes the challenge to the next level, it's called Arena.\n\nSo the app give coins based on the steps you walk daily, but people tend to reach their maximum limit and then stop it. This Arena helps them to challenge them more to get extra coins.\n\n![ktlmwiiqcy.png](https://img.esteem.ws/ktlmwiiqcy.png)\n\nThere are three challenges as of now, but only one activated till now.\n\n1. First challenge is about completing 80000 steps in 7 days i.e. approximately 11500 per day.\n\n2. Second one is about completing 10000 steps in one day, that seams to be the easiest one.\n\n3. The third is little bit challenging as it's asking you to get 250000 steps in 30 days. \n\nI have already started the first challenge and got my 11400 steps done for the day. Hopefully I will be able to walk the same amount of steps everyday. The good thing about it is that in 7 days you will get weekends so even if you could not walk more steps on weekdays you can make up on weekends.\n\nHave you started walking and tracking your steps?","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/ktlmwiiqcy.png\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\",\"fitness\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b4a5978c-3071-5be7-b5ae-9b715e2926cd","title":"2019 Year in Review","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 02, 2020","permlink":"2019-year-in-review","body":"Happy New Year Guys, hope everyone had a great start to their new year. By this post, I would like to review my past year and see how I can improve in the coming year. \n\nIf I compare my [last year Review](https://staging.busy.org/@codingdefined/2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer), I have not contributed much on the open-source world but the numbers are not that bad either. 140contributions is to some extent is ok, but I would like to do much more. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNZpm5WwyPz6joRRnhgj73GFtpL7zPm2aaHiXf2NYTXGM)\n\nThe biggest thing I have completed in 2019 is to learn Angular 6 and also I have completely migrated my project (LetsDisc) from ASP.NET MVC to Angular 6 frontend. Along with that I am also learning advanced JavaScript and will continue to do that. \n\n[LetsDisc](https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc) is a StackOverflow on Steem Blockchain, where you can add your programming questions, though I will continue to work on it and by mid-2020 thinking of releasing the Alpha version of it. That's one of my goals for 2020.\n\nProfessionally I have taken a new job this December and because of that I am less active here as well as in Github and I think it will continue like this for another month or so. I am just getting comfortable in the new job and since it is a little far from where I stay, a lot of time has been getting wasted in the commute.\n\nI also started taking my Photography skills little seriously, bought a new Canon Lens and will continue to explore more on photography, and I must tell you should keep a hobby alongside your day job it does wonders when you are in stress at least it does for me.\n\nOn the blogging side, I have posted around 48 posts last year on my blog https://www.codingdefined.com, i.e. only 4 posts per month. In 2020, hopefully, I will post more and would like to touch at least 8-9 posts per month.\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"opensource\",\"developer\",\"neoxian\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"palnet\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/staging.busy.org\\/@codingdefined\\/2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\\/LetsDisc\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNZpm5WwyPz6joRRnhgj73GFtpL7zPm2aaHiXf2NYTXGM\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"db194522-12da-5465-ab7d-5cf1caf096be","title":"Why I started using StepSetGo","author":"codingdefined","created":"December 27, 2019","permlink":"why-i-started-using-stepsetgo","body":"Rewarding excercise is not common now a days, there are a lot of apps or dapps which reward you for your daily activity. Our own Actifit is one such example, the only reason of not using it that I have to write my daily activities which looks repetitive for me.\n\nSimilarly I came across an app called StepSetGo which is again rewards users based on their activity. It takes your step from Google Fit app, though you don't have to install it for using StepSetGo.\n\n![8ls3s1upjm.png](https://img.esteem.ws/8ls3s1upjm.png)\n\nThe concept of rewarding is different. You need to maintain your level for 3 days otherwise you will be downgraded, if you achieve the highest coins of your level for 3 days you will be upgraded. There are mainly 5 levels as shown below:\n\nIn the first level you can get up to 5 coins and this is one of the easiest level. If you are walking outside you get 1.25 coins for every 1000 steps whereas if you are walking basic steps you get 1 coins for every 1000 steps. Now for getting 5 coins you need maximum 5000 steps. When you get 5 coins for 3 days you will be upgraded to level 2.\n\n![u9paljbtdu.png](https://img.esteem.ws/u9paljbtdu.png)\n\nIn level 2 you need to get 5 coins to stay in level 2 every 3 days. If you do not get 5 coins consecutive for 3 days you will get downgraded to level 1. In the level 2, you need to get 10 coins for 3 days to get upgraded to level 3.\n\n![bnlrfqlgft.png](https://img.esteem.ws/bnlrfqlgft.png)\n\nIn level 3 the safe zone is 10 coins whereas the maximum you can get is 15 coins.\n\n![jhmaklky3m.png](https://img.esteem.ws/jhmaklky3m.png)\n\nIn level 4, the safe zone is 15 coins whereas the maximum is 20 coins.\n\n![5j6iwsnnxn.png](https://img.esteem.ws/5j6iwsnnxn.png)\n\nI think level 5 is the most toughest zone because you need to get 25 coins to be safe whereas maximum you can take is 30 coins.\n\n![ssu1n1oqej.png](https://img.esteem.ws/ssu1n1oqej.png)\n\nI think Level 5 is the toughest level because getting 25 coins means you need to walk atleast 20K steps. I am at level 4 and trying to be in level 4 itself for sometime before moving to level 5.\n\n![juu3vja5vt.png](https://img.esteem.ws/juu3vja5vt.png)\n\nYou can also see how much you have walked till now and the coin balance.\n\n![tmp9r1e77p.png](https://img.esteem.ws/tmp9r1e77p.png)\n\nNow when you have accumulated coins you can buy or get discounts based on your purchase in Bazzar or market. When you get 15000 coins you can redeem IPhone X from that coin isn't it cool.\n\nWhy I really like this app is not about the coins mainly but because you can actually compete with your friends to see who can walk more in a week thus a sense of competition also helps the cause of keeping users motivated. Also there are ways to get more coins when you are on a higher level thus you tend to walk the minimum steps in 3 days just to keep yourself on that level.\n\nHave you used StepSetGo, how was your experience?","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/8ls3s1upjm.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/u9paljbtdu.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/bnlrfqlgft.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/jhmaklky3m.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/5j6iwsnnxn.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/ssu1n1oqej.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/juu3vja5vt.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/tmp9r1e77p.png\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"dblog\",\"realityhubs\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"142ac59a-f625-525d-a484-9eb604393365","title":"A Red Flower Amidst Greenery","author":"codingdefined","created":"December 04, 2019","permlink":"a-red-flower-amidst-greenery","body":"The image was taken while my trekking to Ramanagara. \n\n>Ramanagara is a city as well as a district located in Karnataka which is around 50 km from Bangalore.
