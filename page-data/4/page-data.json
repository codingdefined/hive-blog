It is the biggest one day jump after May 2009 i.e. after 11 years. Being a small-time investor, it's always a feel-good factor to see your holdings go up. I was mainly investing in Financial and got a big hit last month and my portfolio was down around 30%. Today my portfolio rose around 9%.\n\nThough I am investing in Mutual Funds from the last 3-4 years, I have started the stocks trading or rather investing from this year itself. Along with getting a hit, I am not worried because I know in 3-4 months the market will bounce back and you will see everything in green. All the top investors are saying that you should invest some amount now with a time horizon of 3-4 years after keeping sufficient liquidity for any emergencies.\n\nI basically have 3 stocks as of now in my portfolio, in which HDFC bank has got a big hit. Though I am optimistic that in the future it will give me good returns. I have added few SBI Cards share last Friday because the price seems to be good for long term.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcrL8NiADiqyZG4YyteA8Y3NTJV348R8YD4MA9bkTQPCG/image.png)\n\nAlong with the above stocks, I am keeping my eye on these below stocks and will be getting those as and when I will have some money.\n\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmXXGPbZvqCUzVQt5h6MRuUMRX3mwwtzEJs6zY7KdHZb7C/image.png)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"investor\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"finance\",\"steemleo\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmcrL8NiADiqyZG4YyteA8Y3NTJV348R8YD4MA9bkTQPCG\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmXXGPbZvqCUzVQt5h6MRuUMRX3mwwtzEJs6zY7KdHZb7C\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f5bf72c9-430b-5921-8b0e-2283ff661678","title":"What you should not do in Lockdown","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 04, 2020","permlink":"what-you-should-not-do-in-lockdown","body":"The Government of India on 24th March ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement as a preventive measure against the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. India's population is around 1.3 billion, and keeping everyone at home is a very tough task, though the government handled it very well.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQma6ydsioPvmVtAxNsnJnrSNnbxt7hHug8BU2z2s2BogrA/image.png)\n\nThis lockdown does not mean curfew, you can still go out to buy medicine and groceries. It's advisable that only 1 person per family should go out and also not on a daily basis. \n\nI have a family of 3 stays near my house, yesterday the man went to a shop to buy a hair dye. The shopkeeper handed him the packet and said that you shouldn't come to the market if you do not have any critical requirements. The man started abusing verbally saying he is no one to tell him about the rules of lockdown. \n\nThis is what, you should not do in a lockdown. It's our duty to support the government to fight this battle, they are fighting for us and thus they want us to stay home and only come out of the home when its very necessary like getting medicines or groceries.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"corona\",\"covid-19\",\"covid\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQma6ydsioPvmVtAxNsnJnrSNnbxt7hHug8BU2z2s2BogrA\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"2f829c9b-b492-5bff-bd10-bfbfa1be2ef7","title":"Covid-19 Update - India","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 03, 2020","permlink":"covid-19-update-india","body":"There was a sharp increase in numbers in positive Coronavirus cases in India from the last 4-5 days only because of the stupidity of some people. Though still, we are in control but given the number of the population we have, it will be really difficult in the coming days to control this pandemic, especially in India.\n\nAt the time of writing, there are 2640 Positive cases, out of which 192 has recovered whereas 72 are dead.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmYLkzGZ2L3xLhtFKBjWi5xupXNGvB9zRiVNqpqbBfNC24/image.png)\nPC: https://www.covid19india.org/\n\nLiving in Bangalore I can say that people here are following the lockdown quite seriously and it's good. But I am afraid what will happen after 14th April when the lockdown is lifted. People will start going out in large numbers which will make the virus spread again.\n\nTill now people were thinking that how to test if they have coronavirus or not. One of the reason was no one can walk simply and ask the doctors to do the test and other was it is a little risky to go to that hospital where the tests are going on. The good news is Bengaluru-based startup BIONE has launched India's first at-home testing kit for COVID-19. \n\nThis kit as claimed by BIONE is very easy to use and it can display accurate results within minutes. This kit is also approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), displays accurate results within minutes. If you want to test, you need to clean your finger with an alcohol swab and use the lancet provided to finger-prick. The cartridge provided reads the results from the blood sample within 5-10 minutes.\n\nStay Home and Stay Safe","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"covid-19\",\"health\",\"virus\",\"corona\",\"india\",\"neoxian\",\"palnet\",\"oc\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmYLkzGZ2L3xLhtFKBjWi5xupXNGvB9zRiVNqpqbBfNC24\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.covid19india.org\\/\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"c9972d21-531a-5bf4-8b52-565d67951c27","title":"How many months you can survive without Job","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 02, 2020","permlink":"how-many-months-you-can-survive-without-job","body":"#### How many months you can survive without Job\n***\nSo with this Coronavirus affect, there will be a mass layoffs across the globe just like 2008.
