You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here:\n\nhttps://blog.coinbase.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-fork-cba07fe73ef1\n\nForks enable innovation and improvements to digital currency and we believe that we will see an increasing number of forks in the future. We expect this to be a vibrant and innovative community.\n\nWhen a digital currency forks, it creates a new digital asset. Adding new digital assets to Coinbase must be approached with caution. Not every asset is immediately safe to add to Coinbase from a technical stability, security, or compliance point of view. \n\nOur top priority is the safety of customer funds and we spend extensive time designing, building, testing and auditing our systems to ensure that the digital asset we support remains safe and secure. We may not always be first in adding an asset, but if we do, you can be sure that we’ve invested significant time and care into supporting it securely. We believe this is the best approach for us to maintain customer trust.\n\nIn the case of bitcoin cash, we made clear to our customers that we did not feel we could safely support it on the day it was launched. For customers who wanted immediate access to their bitcoin cash, we advised them to withdraw their bitcoin from the Coinbase platform. However, there are several points we want to make clear for our customers:\n\n\nBoth bitcoin and bitcoin cash remain safely stored on Coinbase.\nCustomers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase.\nWe operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events.\nOver the last several days, we’ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers. We made this decision based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes, and regulatory considerations.\n\nWe are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.\n\nOnce supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We'll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support. In the meantime, customer bitcoin cash will remain safely stored on Coinbase.\n\nThank you,\n\nCoinbase Team","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blockchain\",\"crypto\",\"bitcoincash\",\"cyptocurrency\",\"bitcoin\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/blog.coinbase.com\\/what-is-a-bitcoin-fork-cba07fe73ef1\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"5fbc86f0-7735-50f6-9fa5-1794c1ef2897","title":"400 Followers Giveaway - Up To 0.004 SBD For Active Followers!","author":"auskiwi","created":"August 04, 2017","permlink":"400-followers-giveaway-up-to-0-004-sbd-for-active-followers","body":"![400.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmc4LaxpYDCEWuryRJtdvgYw4Xg8YS7ptFYwGQW9riWscK/400.jpg)\n\nThe terms of this giveaway are as follows:\n\nActive followers can participate in any and all of the 4 following actions to take part in this giveaway:\n\n1.

In that three days I have been doing things like, getting the vegetables in order, buying firewood ready for winter, shopping on a budget and then paying the bills. \nAnd then we came across a little problem, which we thought was little and turns out its much much bigger. \nThis lovely house that I have bought here is wonderful and we had a small leak coming in from the roof when it rains, looking up the the ceiling there is a huge damp patch. \n\nBulgarians in their hey day did not use fiberglass insulation in the loft and instead used earth between the beams of the ceiling, so as you can imagine there is a lot of weight above my head. \nSo we asked a few people how much it would be to repair the roof, and all three roofers who went up said the lats are rotten and all need replacing, but they can save the tiles. \nSo what I thought was going to be a couple of hundred Leva, now turns out to be 1400 leva. (Around £640-$700.) This work is urgent because in the winter when its cold I need the house dry or it can create many problems eg damp, mould, a huge hole in the ceiling. \nWhich then means we have even more money to pay out. \n\n# I need your help \nI have seen the steemit community and what the community can do, I am not proud to do this at all, but getting that much money in a month would take away all my monthly income and leave me with nothing to eat and not even able to pay my bills. So I would be working for the roof and August will be a bad month until I get paid in September.  When the winter hits and that water comes into the house it will freeze inside of the roof affected and I have no heating in there, which means the cold will spread through the house and it will be a sorry winter. \n\nI will end up looking like this (you would not want to see me looking like this.)\n\n(https://steemitimages.com/DQmUkaHsVAxFYomrCiFdbfbJ8cZ84XD6oF3j32ZnQUez8pu/image.png)\n\n\n# How can I help?\n\nI need your upvotes and resteems guys to spread the word even if its just a little it will help right now I have taken no money out of my steem account towards anything I see my posts as an investement into the steem platform and help to grow the community. \nBut this time I am out of options and come to you guys cap in hand. \n\nI will update the post later with the picture of the problem in the hope that you can understand and help me out I would really appreciate it. \n\nGuys help me stay warm this winter. \n\nOnce I have hit my target anything remaining if there is enough I will give back to you guys equally with the remaining SPD.

Be sure #introduceyourself in the post.\n\n3. Add appropriate tag: If you want your post to be read by many, you should add an appropriate tag and not some random tags.\n\n4. Difference between Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollar: STEEM is the base liquid currency token in the platform, STEEM Power (abbreviated SP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network (more is better) and Steem Dollars are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. \n\n5.
