The official <b><i>steemit.com</i></b> platform of course provides a very good interface for general use, but sometimes some of us may want to switch to <b><i>chainbb</i></b> to look at the comments in a forum-styled view, or to check detailed statistics of a post on <b><i>steemd</i></b> or<b><i>steemdb</i></b>.\n\n<center>![post platforms.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmc91BJRiCrtV5xnUyhqVAB4oJx76yb56pjdgCEwf3a1xS/post%20platforms.png)</center>\n\n(P.S. It seems that SteemDB and chainBB do not have any official logos. The logos shown above are designed by @stevenlwk)\n\n---\n\n<center><h2>A small trick</h2></center>\n\nSwitching between these 4 platforms is not a convenient task; I used to do a lot of clickings before I can arrive at the corresponding platform. But soon I discovered a slightly more convenient trick: <b><i>you can just edit the domain of the URL of the current page to jump to any other platforms!</i></b> (If you already knew this trick, you may skip to the next section)\n\nFor example, say I am browsing this post on <b><i>steemit.com</i></b>, which has a URL https://steemit.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z.  \nObserve the following table to see the corresponding links on these platforms:\n\nPlatform | Link\n---|---\nSteemit| <a href=\"https://steemit.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemit</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nchainBB| <a href=\"https://beta.chainbb.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>beta.chainbb</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nSteemD| <a href=\"https://steemd.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemd</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nSteemDB| <a href=\"https://steemdb.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemdb</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\n\nIt is not difficult to discover that the only difference between the URLs is their domain names.\n\n---\n<center><h2>Our new tool</h2></center>\n\nUsing the little trick stated can save some time, but can still be quite annoying to change back and forth continuously. Thanks to the idea proposed by my friend @happychau123, we have developed a simple Chrome extension which makes platform switching just two clicks away! What the extension does is replacing the domain in the URL by your desired one. Now you have more time to create quality contents :)\n\n<center><h3>Get <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steemit-switcher/dmgjhbjipbimionibbgobckinffdeanj\"><strong>Steemit Platform Switcher</strong></a> now on Chrome Web Store!</h3></center>\n\n<center>![post logo banner.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPHjau3twj7E5zZ2qx42WWAM7weqDrUqQGza5b2cXKtEL/post%20logo%20banner.png)</center>\n\n---\n<center><h2>How to use</h2></center>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steemit-switcher/dmgjhbjipbimionibbgobckinffdeanj\">Click here </a>to navigate to Chrome Web Store, press <i>ADD TO CHROME</i>.</li>\n\n<center>![web storepng.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmfB6zbzDq7rZedFNwBW6uNUntTNy46ocsaut4MJK7ZZEe/web%20storepng.png)</center>\n\n<li>Press <i>Add extension</i>.</li>\n\n<center>![add ext.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeDm3bqcYYN27pHCx93wZe67N1tSmnAe64EpGUxhhHiiq/add%20ext.png)</center>\n\n<li>Make sure this message pops up.</li>\n\n<center>![added.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPpT9xxE8s7f95Af4zM41kMfv2Mk82eTZrfh7Yqa5fJaM/added.png)</center>\n\n<li>Navigate to any steemit posts on any one of the 4 platforms.</li>\n\n<li>Click the extension button.

If you encounter a similar problem, try to switch to another tab and then switch back. This should solve most of the problems. We are working on it and will provide an update ASAP.\n\n---\n\n<h3>Steemit Platform Switcher is completely free to use.
