Cadaver lab, doing dissections on dead people. Today, we mostly removed skin and fat from the back, but also sliced the medial border of the proximal attachment of the trapezius, and peeled it aside to see underneath. Fascinating stuff, but takes some getting used to.*\n\n                   As usual, there were a lot of great answers this week, so please take some time to read through all the great responses.\n      \n ***\n\n## The question for the Steemit community  today is: What's your proudest moment?\n![IMG_1617.PNG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVoKfLHH8sxPXGCArJ4qeL1Y3LJVQdSJYbsEVKYayjceG/IMG_1617.PNG)\n*Thanks to @epicdesigns for the Ask Steemit logo*\n\nThanks to @snooway for suggesting the question.
