We should know that technology is a space that is forever evolving thus the opportunity to do something might be just around the corner.\n\nSo If you’re a code then it is an opportunity for you. And to quote Walt Disney, “It’s fun to do the impossible.” So, let’s join hands with IBM CALL FOR CODE 2019 Global Challenge and change the world with our coding.\n\n### CALL FOR CODE 2019\n\n>The Call for Code 2019 Global Challenge is a developer competition that seeks technology solutions for natural disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. It is supported by the IBM Code and Response™ initiative, a multi-year program dedicated to creating and deploying open source technologies to tackle the world's biggest challenges.\n\n>Started by David Clark Cause and IBM has committed its association for 5 years. David Clark Cause Launched Call for Code in 2018 alongside Founding Partner IBM. This multi-year global initiative is a rallying cry to developers to use their skills and mastery of the latest technologies, and to create new ones, to drive positive and long-lasting change across the world with their code. The second annual Call for Code Challenge theme is natural disaster preparedness and relief in the context of community health and well-being.\n\n###  OBJECTIVE OF CALL FOR CODE\n\nAs more and more people around the world are affected by these calamities, the need for new approaches toward disaster prevention and response is greater than ever. Today, technology can play a major role in reducing the impact of these incidents. Call for Code has brought together software developers from all over the globe to create innovative. To show the world that developers have the power to save lives in times of natural disaster.Reach out to developers across the world and align them to develop solution/application to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.\n\n###  HOW IT WORKS\n\nTeams are created at the discretion of individual participants with a team being no more than five individuals.
