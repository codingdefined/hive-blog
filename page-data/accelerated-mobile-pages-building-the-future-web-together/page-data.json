We spend a lot of time coding to make the application like that with bunch of testing and everything.\n\nWouldn't it be great if everything is coded for you and you just have to import that in your application, this is where AMP comes into picture where it is very simple to create smooth and faster web pages which is totally controlled-able and customize-able.\n\nAccording to AMP, \n\n>AMP is an open-source library that provides a straightforward way to create web pages that are compelling, smooth, and load near instantaneously for users. AMP pages are just web pages that you can link to and are controlled by you.\n\nIf we talk about architecture than AMP is mainly build on AMP HTML (It is just a plain HTML with some restrictions for improved performance), AMP JS (It is a library is used for fast rendering of AMP HTML pages) and AMP Cache (it is used to serve cached AMP HTML pages).\n\nAn Intro Video by https://www.ampproject.org\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrpkFROqR0Q\n\nWhat I liked most about the project is that it is Open Source and will change the ecosystem of whole internet by serving web pages faster.\n\n---\n## Link\nhttps://www.ampproject.org/\n\n---\n## Contributors\nHunter: @codingdefined\n\n---\n<center><br/>![Steemhunt.com](https://i.imgur.com/jB2axnW.png)<br/>\nThis is posted on Steemhunt - A place where you can dig products and earn STEEM.\n[View on Steemhunt.com](https://steemhunt.com/@codingdefined/accelerated-mobile-pages-building-the-future-web-together)\n</center>","created":"July 20, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Accelerated Mobile Pages - Building the future web, together","permlink":"accelerated-mobile-pages-building-the-future-web-together","previous":{"title":"Getting a Shed from Nature","permlink":"getting-a-shed-from-nature"},"next":{"title":"How much Tax you need to pay for Cryptocurrencies in India?","permlink":"how-much-tax-you-need-to-pay-for-cryptocurrencies-in-india"}}}}
