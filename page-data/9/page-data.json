A place for reviewers.","author":"knowledges","created":"July 22, 2019","permlink":"introducing-realityhubs-a-place-for-reviewers","body":"### Introducing Realityhubs\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/tobaloidee/image/upload/v1563954833/REALITYHUBS%20BANNER/banner_1.png)\n\n\nI’ve been trying to create a home for folks on the Steem blockchain, and this is one of the chance to make it a reality. Lately, many projects sprung up on steem engine, which attracts a bunch of users. I discovered I can also table my idea for everyone to benefit. This is what instigated the implementation of [Realityhubs](https://www.realityhubs.com/). Since Steem engine allows the creation of custom tokens and a Customized UI, based on Steemit condenser on the Steem blockchain, I am happy to announce www.realityhubs.com.\n\n### What is Realityhubs?\n\nRealityHubs is a social media platform where everyone gets rewarded for sharing their perspectives on products, nature, photographs, and other visuals. You can earn by creating and curating contents. RealityHubs leverage a robust digital points system called RHB that supports real values for digital rewards through market price discovery and liquidity. Reality (RHB) token is used in rewarding content on [Realityhubs.com.](www.realityhubs.com)\n\nThe project is built on Steem engine, using the Nitrous interface. It is a resemblance of [Steemit,](https://steemit.com) (A social media platform with almost the same characteristics). Realityhubs is created for people to post their contents and get rewarded in RHB tokens. If you are an existing steemian (Steemit.com user), you can log in to Realityhubs. using your Steem posting key. Preferably, use [Steemkeychain ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steem-keychain/lkcjlnjfpbikmcmbachjpdbijejflpcm?hl=en) browser extension. If you do not own a Steem account yet, click [here](https://signup.steemit.com/) to create one. \n\n### A quick overview of what realityhubs support\n\nThe platform is created for anyone using products, seeing the beauty of nature, and taking pictures. Realistically, everybody can partake in Realityhubs. Looking at what the platform offers, it is clear that everyone has something to present within their confinements. Let’s start with; ‘‘Products’’.\n\n### Products\n\nThe word products drop different thoughts in our minds,  like Cars, phones, Watches, Clothes, Shoes, Foods, e.t.c. We are right, but there is more to the definition of products. We can also see products from the end of intangibility. We can see them as intangible objects to offer other benefits. It could be a piece of professional advice from a lawyer, doctor, engineer, and so on. Once people can benefit from these ideas, it is also a product you are offering to the society. Mainly, Products include events, ideas, persons, places, organizations, and the things we see around us in and outside our homes. So don’t hesitate to review your home appliances. Take a shot and tell the world everything about the product.\n\n### Nature\n\nNature is a natural phenomenon in our environments. Nature exists without the effort of anyone bringing it into being. Sun, Organisms, Rivers, Animals, Rocks, e.t.c, are examples of nature. You are welcome to talk about all these in your way. Just make it nice and give the original image of what you are reviewing.\n\n### Photographs\n\nThis is a specific niche. They say a picture worth more than a thousand words. Every unique object worth a shot. You visit a new environment, and you see many new things. All you need to do is to raise your camera, take the shot, add your thoughts and share it on Realityhubs. Abstract, astrophotography, creative, documentary, drone, fashion, and other types of photographic work are very welcome. So, we do not restrict you to anything.\n\n### Other visuals\n\nOne of the primary purposes of the project is your perspectives on anything and everything. You see many things of value every day, and you feel like talking about them. A visual might have a primary purpose, but what did you see that isn't clear to anyone else? This is basically about your visual impressions on Graphics, logos, Artistic Illustrations, Technical designs, and so on.\n\n### RealityHubs Token (RHB)\n\nWe created this smart contract organizational token (SCOT) to incentivize every ''Realhubbers'' (Users of the Realityhubs website) that will use Realityhub platform. As I’ve mentioned above, the platform rewards contents related to the reviewing of products, talk about nature, photographs, and other visuals.\n\n\nI believe this is wide enough for everyone to contribute their quota. As users earn Reality token, they can decide to stake it in their account as RHB Power to increase their voting power or trade it on the Steem engine platform.\n\nThe payout on every post will be in 7 days. The concept of payout time is not different from what we have on steemit. Also, the value of RHB vote on any content will fluctuate depending on the market forces as well as the consensus which includes the upvotes and downvotes. And the payout will be on a 50/50 basis for author and curators.\n\n### Token distribution\n\nThe total supply of Reality token is 500,000,000 (Five hundred million), while the current circulating supply is 100,000,000 RHB (One hundred million).\n\nWe will airdrop 300,000 (Three hundred thousand) RHB tokens to active users of the Steem blockchain, which will be segmented into three tiers. The distribution will be explained below.\n\n#### First tier\n\n150,000 RHB (One hundred and fifty thousand) tokens will be distributed randomly to people who comment and resteem this post, within the next 14 days. \n\n#### Second tier\n\nWe will distribute 100,000 RHB tokens to everyone that buy and stake their tokens within the 14 days airdrop period. This means if you buy and stake your token, you will get a share from 100,000 RHB reserved for stakers. For example, if you buy and stake 10,000 RHB, your share from the 100,000 will be calculated as follows;\n\n`your stake * 100,000 / total RHB staked by all users`\n\nSo, if the total number of RHB staked is 260,000, you will get a bonus of\n\n`10,000 * 100,000/ 260,000` = **3846.1538 RHB Token.**\n\n#### Third tier\n\nThe first five people with the highest stake will receive a bonus of 50,000 RHB (Fifty thousand) tokens which will be distributed with the formula below.\n\n`staked amount * 50,000/ the total stake of the five winners.`\n\nFor example, if the first position staked 30,000 RHB, and the total stakes of the first five is 120,000 RHB, the calculation goes thus.\n\n`30,000 * 50,000/120,000` = **12,5000 RHB.**\n\nAll these will be distributed in 14 days, on the **5th of August 2019**. We are ready to make all our users feel at home. The platform will be a place for all. No segregation. Post, buy, stake, and get the full benefit. We would be happy to have you around us.  \n\n#### Current selling price of RHB\nThe current RHB value is $0.05.\nWith the current Steem value, 1 Steem is equivalent to 5 RHB tokens. \n\n\n\n### Scotbot settings\n\nauthor_curve_exponent: 1.0 \nauthor_reward_percentage: 50 \nbeneficiaries_account: null \nbeneficiaries_reward_percentage: 0 \ncashout_window_days: 7 \ncuration_curve_exponent: 0.5 \ndownvote_power_consumption: 200 \ndownvote_regeneration_seconds: 432000 \ndownvote_window_days: -1 \nenable_account_muting: false \nissue_token: false\njson_metadata_app_value: json_\njson_metadata_key: tags \njson_metadata_value: realityhubs\nminer_tokens: {} \nmining_pool_claim_number: 0 \nmining_pool_claims_per_year: 0 \nmuting_account: \nn_daily_posts_muted_accounts: 0 \nother_pool_accounts: {} \nother_pool_percentage: 0 \nother_pool_send_token_per_year: 0 \npob_pool_percentage: 100 \nposm_pool_percentage: 0 \npost_reward_curve: default \npost_reward_curve_parameter: \npromoted_post_account: realitypromo \nreduction_every_n_block: 10512000 \nreduction_percentage: 0.5 \nrewards_token: 10 \nrewards_token_every_n_block: 1 \nstaking_pool_claim_number: 0 \nstaking_pool_claims_per_year: 0 \nstaking_pool_percentage: 0 \ntoken: RHB \ntoken_account: realityhubs\nvote_power_consumption: 200 \nvote_regeneration_seconds: 432000 \nvote_window_days: -1\n\n# Conclusion\nWe would like to welcome everyone willing to share their thoughts with the world.

In this we will be going through Back End first i.e. ASP.NET Core part and then we will go through the frontend i.e. Angular.\n\nI have written a function UploadProfilePicture in UserAppService which will handle the upload of profile pic and then create image on a predefined location. \n\nThe logic behind it very straight forward where we are providing the path where the file will be stored. We check if the directory exists or not, if not then creating the directory. Then we are creating the file stream object and then storing the file in that location.\n\n```\npublic async Task<string> UploadProfilePicture([FromForm(Name = \"uploadedFile\")] IFormFile file, long userId)\n{\n  if (file == null || file.Length == 0)\n    throw new UserFriendlyException(\"Please select profile picture\");\n\n  var folderName = Path.Combine(\"Resources\", \"ProfilePics\");\n  var filePath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), folderName);\n\n  if (!Directory.Exists(filePath))\n  {\n    Directory.CreateDirectory(filePath);\n  }\n\n  var uniqueFileName = $\"{userId}_profilepic.png\";\n  var dbPath = Path.Combine(folderName, uniqueFileName);\n\n  using (var fileStream = new FileStream(Path.Combine(filePath, uniqueFileName), FileMode.Create))\n  {\n    await file.CopyToAsync(fileStream);\n  }\n\n  return dbPath;\n}\n```\n\n### Few things to note here :\n\n1. IFormFile object will come as null if the name attribute of the file input is not same as that of the name of the parameter used in the controller. So you should name then same or use [FromForm(Name = \"\")] and then assign the name as shown below.\n\n2. Since we are creating a new directory we need to tell ASP.NET Core to serve the static files from that location. For that we need to modify the Configure method of Startup.cs class as shown below :\n\n```\napp.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions()\n{\n FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), @\"Resources\")),\n RequestPath = new PathString(\"/Resources\")\n});\n```\n\n3. When using IFormFile, the swagger will give you multiple text boxes like ContentType, ContentDisposition, Headers, Length, Name, FileName etc  instead of file upload control. To change the textboxes to the actual file upload control we need to implement IOperationFilter and then implement the apply method as shown below. The main part is type where we need to define file, since we are clearing all the previous parameters we also need to add the user id parameter.\n\n```\nusing Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger;\n\nusing Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen;\n\nnamespace LetsDisc.Web.Host.Startup\n{\n public class FileUploadOperation : IOperationFilter\n {\n  public void Apply(Operation operation, OperationFilterContext context)\n  {\n   if (operation.OperationId.ToLower().Contains(\"upload\")))\n   {\n    operation.Parameters.Clear();\n    operation.Parameters.Add(new NonBodyParameter\n    \t{\n          Name = \"uploadedFile\",\n          In = \"formData\",\n          Description = \"Upload File\",\n          Required = true,\n          Type = \"file\"\n        });\n    operation.Parameters.Add(new NonBodyParameter\n        {\n          Name = \"userId\",\n          In = \"query\",\n          Description = \"\",\n          Required = true,\n          Type = \"long\"\n        });\n    operation.Consumes.Add(\"multipart/form-data\");\n   }\n  }\n }\n}\n```\n\nThus we are finished with the backend, now we will go forward with the frontend implementation.\n\n### HTML\n\nIn HTML we will have an input of type file and then we have both change and click function so that user can upload the same image twice.\n\n```\n<div class=\"col-md-3 profile-image-edit\">\n <label class=\"hoverable\" for=\"fileInput\">\n ... img tag\n  <span class=\"hover-text\">Choose file</span>\n  <span class=\"background\"></span>\n </label>\n <br />\n <input #fileInput id=\"fileInput\" type='file' (click)=\"fileInput.value = null\" value=\"\" (change)=\"onSelectFile($event.target.files)\">\n <button class=\"btn btn-default\" *ngIf=\"url\" (click)=\"delete()\">delete</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### CSS\n\n```\n.hoverable {\n    position: relative;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    height: 150px;\n    width: 150px;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n}\n\n    .hoverable .hover-text {\n        position: absolute;\n        display: none;\n        top: 50%;\n        left: 50%;\n        transform: translate(-50%,-50%);\n        z-index: 2;\n    }\n\n    .hoverable .background {\n        position: absolute;\n        display: none;\n        top: 0;\n        left: 0;\n        bottom: 0;\n        right: 0;\n        background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);\n        pointer-events: none;\n        border-radius: 50%;\n        z-index: 1;\n    }\n\n    .hoverable:hover .hover-text {\n        display: block;\n    }\n\n    .hoverable:hover .background {\n        display: block;\n    }\n```\n\n### Code Behind\n\nIn the code behind we will have a function which has a fileReader ojject to preview the image as well as we will be calling our backend service for uploading the image.\n\n```\nonSelectFile(files: FileList) {\n        \n  if (files.length === 0)\n    return;\n        \n  this.fileToUpload = files.item(0);\n\n        \n  const fileReader: FileReader = new FileReader();\n  fileReader.readAsDataURL(this.fileToUpload);\n\n  fileReader.onload = (event: any) => {\n    this.url = event.target.result;\n  };\n\n  this.files.push({ data: this.fileToUpload, fileName: this.fileToUpload.name });\n\n  this._userService.uploadProfilePicture(this.files[0], this.user.id)\n    .subscribe((result: string) => {\n      this.userDetails.profileImageUrl = result;\n  });\n}\n\ndelete() {\n  this.url = null;\n}\n```\n\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZixJCZe7FHI/XTBzBny_23I/AAAAAAAAC_A/Rz7nQPU6RTYu_z9BkH7a3_tPhei6mXeKQCLcBGAs/s1600/angularerror.PNG)\n\nGitHub Commit: https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc/commit/ab7af63ba3cf94c23278fc2fe00d3769672bf506\n\n----\n\n## Also Published: [CodingDefined.com](https://www.codingdefined.com/2019/07/uploading-image-from-angular-to-aspnet.html)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"development\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/1.bp.blogspot.com\\/-YFj71Z8esZw\\/XTB0OKvoyMI\\/AAAAAAAAC_I\\/VDylqIfgRBIVO5HN2BFwFedz5RkckzkWACLcBGAs\\/s1600\\/angularerror.PNG\",\"https:\\/\\/1.bp.blogspot.com\\/-ZixJCZe7FHI\\/XTBzBny_23I\\/AAAAAAAAC_A\\/Rz7nQPU6RTYu_z9BkH7a3_tPhei6mXeKQCLcBGAs\\/s1600\\/angularerror.PNG\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\\/LetsDisc\\/commit\\/ab7af63ba3cf94c23278fc2fe00d3769672bf506\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2019\\/07\\/uploading-image-from-angular-to-aspnet.html\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"772236b6-9f61-5ebd-a970-c9951b9465fc","title":"Focus for a little longer","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 12, 2019","permlink":"focus-for-a-little-longer-78e9e8e02afeb","body":"We hear everyone in every phase of our life say that you need to be focus to achieve something. But focus for how long they never say it. Our human brain gets distracted very easily and being in focus requires a hell lot of effort if you want to achieve something. \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/aoxzfexqko.jpg)\n\nFor example if you want to understand a math problem you need to keep your focus till the time that problem is solved but what about the next problem. Should you keep the same focus or you need to start all over again.\n\nWhat have I learn is to keep focus until you can. If even being in focus nothing is going in your way then you need to give yourself a break and start all over again when your mind is fully rested. So many times it happens with me that I could not solve a bug in my code but when I start looking it again with the same intensity and focus the next day some or the other solutions start working.\n\nSo what we call a distraction is not actually a distraction is a way of you mind to say you that give the mind some rest to start focusing again. This also should be taught to you in every phase of life just like everyone taught you to keep focusing.\n\nWe all know life is not easy that means being in focus everyday will not get you the desired result then what should you do. This is were the mentor comes in picture who can help you to come out of that situation. That mentor can be your friend, teacher parents or even your colleague whom you never talk with.","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/aoxzfexqko.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"focus\",\"blog\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e288d573-b2bd-50dd-ab19-3f51aaae9fcf","title":"Are you afraid of coming out of Comfort Zone?","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 06, 2019","permlink":"are-you-afraid-of-coming-out-of-comfort-zone-8873ab06f8d2a","body":"We all have been in our comfort zone from time to time and it's not the bad thing.

For ex, you are in your comfortable job but wanted to do something of your own, that is actually meaning you want to take a risk of losing the job as well as might be losing the money of your new venture if that is not successful. \n\nPeople like me are always afraid to take this bold step because we know that we have a family which depends on us. Now this makes us a mediocre in front of people who has taken a risk and became successful. Until and unless you come out of your comfort zone you will not achive a great success in any field you are in.\n\nThus even if you are not able to come out of the comfort zone try to make your comfort zone uncomfortable.

The setting is very similar to Palnet and you also most probably got an airdrop if you have PAL tokens. According to SteemLeo it is a community for investors. Now, what does that mean, if you are investing anything like Money, Time or Knowledge on anything then this community is for you. \n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQCkkaiW4CZQpdcq7rN9VmUNrSL5YTjcQDswRWLTdaMb8/steemleo.com%20is%20live.png\n\nPC: https://steemit.com/steemleo/@steem.leo/a-new-scot-tribe-on-the-block-or-introducing-steemleo-a-community-for-investors\n\n### What content I will post on SteemLeo?\n\nWe are all into Crypto space, so you might be thinking a lot of posts will be made on crypto. But that is not the only investment we have. If you have some money in your bank, and getting interested that is also one form of investment. If you are into Mutual Funds, that is also one type of investment. When I will be writing anything which revolves around money I will most probably add a steemleo tag.\n\n### Is SteemLeo Moderated?\n\nNow the real question is, is the community moderated for spam. When someone creates 100 of posts which does not have anything related to investment, that too gets posted if you have used the tag. I would like it to be moderated so that we will only see genuine investment posts and not any other posts.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"steemleo\",\"new\",\"scottribe\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/640x0\\/https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmQCkkaiW4CZQpdcq7rN9VmUNrSL5YTjcQDswRWLTdaMb8\\/steemleo.com%20is%20live.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/steemleo\\/@steem.leo\\/a-new-scot-tribe-on-the-block-or-introducing-steemleo-a-community-for-investors\"]}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":80,"numPages":74,"currentPage":9}}}
