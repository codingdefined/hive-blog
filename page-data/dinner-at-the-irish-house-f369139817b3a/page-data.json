The Irish House was at the 3rd floor of the VR Mall. The VR Mall is all set for Christmas celebration, as there were lights and christmas tree setup.\n\n![image](https://img.esteem.ws/vcvwm3ixi1.jpg)\n\nNow coming back to the party, started with a Bourbon mocktail which is a new arrival in the store just for Christmas Celebration. I must say you should try it at least once.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/m9jszlpd8v.jpg)\n\nThen we had starters and main dishes. Though I relly do not like the main dish much but the starter was really good.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/owxsazviyr.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/mtqzxy77i8.jpg)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6","created":"December 15, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Dinner at The Irish House","permlink":"dinner-at-the-irish-house-f369139817b3a","previous":{"title":"A Security Breach in Quora ","permlink":"a-security-breach-in-quora"},"next":{"title":"2018 Year in Review as an Open Source Developer","permlink":"2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer"}}}}
