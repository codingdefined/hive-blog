This is what I love about Bangalore, once called as a City of Many Lakes because of so many lakes around but reduced to very few lakes, nowadays. Though still there are fewer lakes its better than other cities of India. So since Monsoon has already started its good to walk or sit beside the lake to get the cool breeze and get the grasp of nature.\n\nThe images are clicked on my evening walk near the Nagawara Lake. Again the lake is well maintained and the whole family can visit and enjoy their time.\n\n## People enjoying boating in the lake.\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdGHjBG24yQsiahWBReMkWpruJ8sQkJDrUTSmiyeNePQ9/image.png)\n\n## A Duck flying over the lake\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQma4whcAwKdvzJEbRT3fYcLV6iSWBoTodowrs53LkJ7tyM/image.png)\n\n## Again a beutiful scene of the lake\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcYK32k96wzaxTJz815V4QPvdhhdsqShmjDgXHCD3Qipf/image.png)\n\n## Trying to capture a water droplet, failed miserably :(\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmW9JKgbGysiFuwW3ZmJpR294rDMEifXsH73Hmur1yw8Hr/image.png)\n\n## Few more captures of the Water Droplets\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaAo3E9vqnc2q89csNjjVw3VK1ztpoA5TFuZohNMmhsKJ/image.png)\n\n## Not so good photo\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeuKd2qwuCK1ZMj7XKG4XEAZvLXZ554jgvA5z6Yk5Tpkw/image.png)\n\n# Camera : Nokia 6","created":"June 22, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A walk beside the Lake","permlink":"a-walk-beside-the-lake","previous":{"title":"Have you Reviewed Someone's Code","permlink":"have-you-reviewed-someone-s-code"},"next":{"title":"Office Party be like - Drinks and Food","permlink":"office-party-be-like-drinks-and-food-7c6134b1b4ae1"}}}}
