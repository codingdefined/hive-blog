Adhering to the traffic signal itself is a task that proves too difficult for most people. And in a country where flouting traffic rules is so widespread, accidents and mishaps are commonplace. Instead of blaming the government and whining about it, it’s about time that we started paying heed to Road Safety so that we can make our roads safer and more enjoyable to drive/ride on.\n\nYou might have noticed that some road markings are either white or yellow and sometimes they are continuous or broken. Each of these road markings in India are actually different signs that grant varying permissions to drivers on the road. Here’s what each one of them means.\n\nBroken White Line\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQmJh2VCkEP1g672QpbE7nwVAvy2M5HXTvFHwKByEi5bu/image.png)\n\nThe most common of road markings in India, a broken white line indicates that you may change lanes, overtake vehicles or make a U-turn after seeing that it is safe to do so.\n\nSolid White Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRajTTg9xTw41iXCuGuCV3kGvcV7r6byzpVs3CsoSmozR/image.png)\n\nYou cannot overtake a vehicle or make a U-turn if your on a road with a continuous white line. However, you may cross the line to avoid an obstruction or to exit the road to enter a perpendicular road.\n\nDouble Yellow Lines - Road Markings in India :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ6h5Ejxw4ccuZptwdJZUS8NpgS4fkbyZRvVXNScqnvaq/image.png)\n\nDouble Yellow lines can never be crossed unless it is to avoid a major obstruction. Usually used on 2-lane roads, it’s used to prevent crossing over into the lane with traffic going in the opposite direction.\n\nSingle Yellow Line next to a Broken Yellow Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY3DLd1dom4PZ2mVaYriTbbbU6CXBEm4fZv1dwxpSfJeC/image.png)\n\nThis type of road marking combines the rules of the first two markings in this list. If you are driving on the side with the broken line, you are allowed to overtake and if you’re driving on the side of the solid line, you’re not.\n\nNow, you are more theoretically qualified to be driving or riding on Indian roads than majority of the public. The next time you’re out on the road, see if you can follow these rules or spot anyone doing so.","created":"July 14, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Road Markings in India Explained","permlink":"road-markings-in-india-explained","previous":{"title":"My photography - Mushrooms (Original) 捡磨菇","permlink":"7qh3q-my-photography-mushrooms-original"},"next":{"title":"STEEM at .96 Cents / SBD at .86 Cents - Bitcoin loosing $1,300 in 3 weeks.
