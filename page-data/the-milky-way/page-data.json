We can see it in the night sky, although we don't see the whole thing because we look at it from the inside. There is a lot of information about the milky way and our universe, but whether or not the information is accurate is debatable. A lot of it is based on unproven theories, which are also not disproved either. Some of these are Black Holes, Dark Matter, the Big Bang and so on.\n\nThe Constellation Sagittarius is where the center of the milky way can be found in the night sky. The Milky Way looks like a band of light and darkness in the night sky with the naked eye and it is because of this that it is called the Milky Way. The light comes from stars in the Milky Way and the darkness comes from cosmic dust, blocking the light. Cameras are able to take better photos than what we can see, although seeing it in the night sky with the naked eye is spectacular in it's own right. The Milky Way is better seen in rural areas where there is little to no light pollution. It is also most clearly seen when the moon is below the horizon, when it is new moon and when the sky is clear with no clouds, humidity or air pollution.\n\nI personally love going on Hikes in the mountains where there is no civilization of any kind and looking at the stars, especially the Milky Way. Enjoy the pictures!\n\n![enter image description here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1608/ganab_mosaic.jpg)\n[Image Credit](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1608/ganab_mosaic.jpg)\n\nThis is a different Galaxy from ours, if we could see our Galaxy from the out side it should look similar.\n![enter image description here](http://www.et.byu.edu/~mfreemie/security/picture8.jpeg)\n[Image Credit](http://www.et.byu.edu/~mfreemie/security/picture8.jpeg)\n\n![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/PgYKaSd.jpg)\n[Image Credit](http://i.imgur.com/PgYKaSd.jpg)","created":"July 07, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"The Milky Way","permlink":"the-milky-way","previous":{"title":"Beautiful Purple","permlink":"beautiful-purple-201777t211143357z"},"next":{"title":"Beautiful India #9 - Flower Garden in Udaipur","permlink":"beautiful-india-9-flower-garden-in-udaipur"}}}}
