When you open the console you will get an error like cannot read property 'id' of null.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511156690/ly8yb5uld8zir7qhndlz.png)\n\nTo fix this issue I need to add an extra parameter when we go through all the contributions as shown below. At first, we were checking if the projectId is present, but we need to check repository id as well.\n\n`if (match.params.projectId && contribution.json_metadata.repository.id)`\n\nCommit of the previous change: https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/105/commits/28b38ab1da5493c4bebf1971bf3ad9b1fc8fd055\n\n<hr>\n\n[Issue #12](https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/issues/12) - Search results disappear when scrolling to the bottom as shown below. In the inspect element you can see that we are querying a lot of times\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511157133/bscbqjfvg6upyde8ixen.png)\n\nTo fix this issue we have to limit the API query to only up-to how many results we have. To fix this I have changed SearchFeed.js file to inlcude the below code \n```\nif(this.total !== 0 && this.total <= this.state.skip){\n   return;\n}\n```\nThus when the total results are less than the querying result, I am returning from there and not going to call the contributions again.\n\nCommit of the change : https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/105/commits/7efb3ffb3f8bed9f8ecfdd205ae9cc4264bcbb46\n\nPull Requests : https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/105\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/fixing-few-bugs-in-utopian-io\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 20, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Fixing Few Bugs in Utopian.io","permlink":"fixing-few-bugs-in-utopian-io","previous":{"title":"Travel to Iskcon Temple Bangalore","permlink":"travel-to-iskcon-temple-bangalore"},"next":{"title":"50% SBD is not receiving when Reward dropdown changed","permlink":"50-sbd-is-not-receiving"}}}}
