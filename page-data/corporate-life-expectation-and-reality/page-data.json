You can't actually show off cK, USPA,Arrow in front of friends. Never enjoyed food in 7-Star or 5-Stars. Rather enjoyed a lot during B.TECH time at roadside having just 30–40 bucks in pocket or having 130/- econo meal in Mcd once a month along with all friends.\n\n2 - Expectation \n\nNew bike in just 3 months. Full fun.\n\nReality\n\nGot the same. But nobody was there on backseat to sing stupid songs with stupid lyrics. Missed the activa bike rides of university.\n\n3 - Expectation \n\nBrand new co's laptop & co's mobile with great postpaid plans, unlimited internet data.\n\nReality \n\nNow i7 , 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 2GB NVIDIA GC, 2 in 1, is just being used for SQL, PPT & EXCEL. No time to call friends. Out of 100GB 4G data hardly 2–3 GB is being used monthly. Survival on 1GB 2G was the best part of life during university.\n\n4 - Expectation\n\nExcel in core field.\n\nReality\n\nExcel in MS-EXCEL only.\n\n5 - Expectation \n\nNow I have a job & after 1 year I'll propose my university crush.\n\nReality\n\nShe is already a mother of 1 month child now.\n\n6 - Expectation\n\nOwn cabin, A.C installed, free meals, free coffee etc etc.\n\nReality\n\nGot fatty, instead of 6packs got family pack. Gained 14kg in 2 years & now trying to shed like anything.\n\n7 - Expectation\n\nCorporate parties.\n\nReality\n\nStaying silent & having a glass of beer in formals is actually weird. Having 2 beer & 5 friends during university was the best part of life.","created":"August 17, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Corporate Life - Expectation and Reality","permlink":"corporate-life-expectation-and-reality","previous":{"title":"A trip to Bali Captured","permlink":"a-trip-to-bali-captured"},"next":{"title":"How popular is Steemit in Your Country","permlink":"how-popular-is-steemit-in-your-country"}}}}
