I am a vegetarian thus I have limited option but still once in a while we try something new. Vermicelli is like a pasta but it's a slim thread.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/jc6b3kamx5.jpg)\n\nIn the packet it said roast before use but you can also boil it just like noodles, this is how I made it. I have boiled around 2 cups of vermicelli and then added two spoons of oil in it so that it should not stick together. \n\nAfter done I have cut some veggies like beans, carrot, onion and potato. \n\n![image](https://img.esteem.ws/rvanw3agaz.jpg)\n\nThen I fried some onion in a pam using three tablespoon of oil.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/j1jlxpybqd.jpg)\n\nAfter that I have added some veggies and close the lid to cook it for some time.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/bfascvncmu.jpg)\n\nAfter some time added the vermicelli and some soy sauce and then it's ready.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/xttpl5en14.jpg) \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/4bdu7bvrnt.jpg)","created":"June 29, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Cooking After Long Time - Vegan Vermicilli","permlink":"cooking-after-long-time-vegan-vermicilli-eea29aa4548a1","previous":{"title":"2 Years on Steemit","permlink":"2-years-on-steemit"},"next":{"title":"Why Use Public Transport","permlink":"why-use-public-transport-a556bbfba0e4c"}}}}
