Along with the power the design of it is totally awesome. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbQZvbdZjbuCEXv3Jv6n7ApbsakzKpEDnjJ4E3vdczMaR/image.png)\n\nThe handling of the bike is too good even though the riding position is slightly tipped-forward. Along with handling one think I must say that it is fuel efficient too with giving me around 50kmpl easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQma4sBgZdJFYzywDrRrUHBx2U5FR8sF8egszbYvfsejZU5/image.png)\n\nAs of now the only problem I have faced is that the Bike's back Brake is not that great. You have to apply front brake everytime if you need to stop immediately. Pillion rider will have some discomfort as the pillion seat is narrower.","created":"July 06, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"One Month of Riding Experience of Suzuki Gixxer","permlink":"one-month-of-riding-experience-of-suzuki-gixxer","previous":{"title":"Are you living in Sync with Nature?","permlink":"are-you-living-in-sync-with-nature"},"next":{"title":"Hanuman Temple at Agraha - Bangalore","permlink":"hanuman-temple-at-agraha-bangalore-cc9feb08e59f7"}}}}
