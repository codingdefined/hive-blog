If the message is not supplied, frontend waits for the response for some time and then finally at the time out it says \"No Message Supplied\". In that waiting period, if you have come from any other's projects section, the projects of that person will be shown in your profile because front end still waits for the server to get appropriate message.\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nFixing Bug is relatively simple, it is just that we need to add a JSON message along with the status as shown below\n\n###### For 404 Status\n\n```\nres.status(404).json({\n  message: 'Cannot find project for this account'\n});\n```\n\n###### For 403 Status\n\n```\nres.status(403).json({\n  message: 'Server refuses to give details of the account'\n})\n```\n\nCommit : https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io/pull/28/commits/d05cfc53c7234ce864daf1677f8a0956d7440752\nPull request : https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io/pull/28\n\nValidation\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510822614/uhxsrpwecszpubuptude.png)\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/json-message-along-with-status\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 16, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"JSON message along with Status","permlink":"json-message-along-with-status","previous":{"title":"How to Learn Programming - A Beginner's Guide","permlink":"how-to-learn-programming-a-beginner-s-guide"},"next":{"title":"Someone Watching us through the Sky","permlink":"someone-watching-us-through-the-sky"}}}}
