By this post, I would like to review my past year and see how I can improve in the coming year. \n\nIf I compare my [last year Review](https://staging.busy.org/@codingdefined/2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer), I have not contributed much on the open-source world but the numbers are not that bad either. 140contributions is to some extent is ok, but I would like to do much more. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNZpm5WwyPz6joRRnhgj73GFtpL7zPm2aaHiXf2NYTXGM)\n\nThe biggest thing I have completed in 2019 is to learn Angular 6 and also I have completely migrated my project (LetsDisc) from ASP.NET MVC to Angular 6 frontend. Along with that I am also learning advanced JavaScript and will continue to do that. \n\n[LetsDisc](https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc) is a StackOverflow on Steem Blockchain, where you can add your programming questions, though I will continue to work on it and by mid-2020 thinking of releasing the Alpha version of it. That's one of my goals for 2020.\n\nProfessionally I have taken a new job this December and because of that I am less active here as well as in Github and I think it will continue like this for another month or so. I am just getting comfortable in the new job and since it is a little far from where I stay, a lot of time has been getting wasted in the commute.\n\nI also started taking my Photography skills little seriously, bought a new Canon Lens and will continue to explore more on photography, and I must tell you should keep a hobby alongside your day job it does wonders when you are in stress at least it does for me.\n\nOn the blogging side, I have posted around 48 posts last year on my blog https://www.codingdefined.com, i.e. only 4 posts per month. In 2020, hopefully, I will post more and would like to touch at least 8-9 posts per month.\n","created":"January 02, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"2019 Year in Review","permlink":"2019-year-in-review","previous":{"title":"Why I started using StepSetGo","permlink":"why-i-started-using-stepsetgo"},"next":{"title":"Arena Tab added to StepSetGo","permlink":"arena-tab-added-to-stepsetgo"}}}}
