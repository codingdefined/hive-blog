Confused words are often used and this is because it sounds right, but it is not. These words sound so similar, this is where the problem comes in.\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FXHMs7el33Q/VHTS5_wRx7I/AAAAAAAAFts/qvHVhcbtoOc/s1600/How-to-Improve-Your-Writing-Skills.jpeg\n[Image credit](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FXHMs7el33Q/VHTS5_wRx7I/AAAAAAAAFts/qvHVhcbtoOc/s1600/How-to-Improve-Your-Writing-Skills.jpeg)\n\nHomophones\n----------\n\nThis is the biggest cause for all the confusing words one can read in someones writing. Why English decided to do this... well if you ask me they just wanted to be difficult. If the English language just decided to be simple and not so confusing, this would all be gone and we would never have to worry about it. \n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9pXiFG3z5M/hqdefault.jpg\n[Image credit](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9pXiFG3z5M/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nIf you ask me English causes a lot of stress and unnecessary worry. It is making me old and grey with all it's rules and exceptions, and extra exceptions to the exceptions.\n\n**Accept/Except**\nAccept:Is a verb, this means that someone or something is doing the accepting.\n\t\nI accept you for being who you are.\nI do not accept your laziness.\n\nExcept: Is a word that functions like \"excluding\".\n\t\nI love ice-cream, except when it is melted.\nMost days are sunny during winter except when there is a cold front.\n \n**Affect/Effect** \nThis is one I often get wrong. A way that I have learnt how to tell the difference, is the **A**. The **A** represents action.\n\nAffect: Is a verb, where something or someone is affecting something else.\n\tThat story affected me more than the others.\n\nEffect: is usually a noun.\n\tThat story *had* an **effect** on my life.\n\nSee how the *had* is now the verb and **effect** is a noun.\n\n**Its/It‚Äôs**\nIts: is possessive.\n\tThe clown lost its red nose.\n\nIt's: is a contraction of \"it is\".\n\tIt's going to be a rainy day today.\n\nWe always think that the apostrophe shows possession \"Tim's car\", but its is similar to the words his and her, therefore its is possession. With \"It's\" just break it up into it is \n\n**Loose/Lose**\nAnother one I struggle with. Whenever you need to use loose/lose in the context of, you lost something, just replace the *t* with an *e* to get the right one.\n\nLoose: is not tight, but loose.\n\tThe door was loose.\n\nLose: in the past tense is *lost*.\n\tYou will lose this game if you keep playing like this.\n\n**To/Too**\nToo: indicates, *excess* or means *also*.\n\tI too want to got to the movie\n\tIt is way too much food for me to eat\n\nTo: must be used in all other circumstances.\n\n**Weather/Whether**\nWhen it comes to this one just think of water, there is no *h* in water, therefore weather relates to the conditions around us.\n\tThe  weather is looking bad today, we will get rain.\n\nWhether: is proceeded by an opinion\n\tWeather or not it rains, I will be happy.\n\nThere are many many more of these words.

I will be doing pushups, situps and squats for the amount of $$$ (ratio;$1:1) I earn on this post and will give a short feedback every day at the end of each post. This will be split in equally between all 3. Any not done will carry onto the next day.*","created":"July 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Improve your Writing (Confused Words)","permlink":"improve-your-writing-confused-words","previous":{"title":"üèÖDaily TOP posts & authors and stats in the past 7 days (Jun 27 to Jul 03)","permlink":"daily-top-posts-authors-and-stats-in-the-past-7-days-2017-06-27-2017-07-03-1"},"next":{"title":"Free BitCoin - Get Free Satoshis Slowly and Steadily","permlink":"free-bitcoin-get-free-satoshis-slowly-and-steadily"}}}}
