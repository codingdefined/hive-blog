Though everyone says that whenever you have age by your side you should invest more on equity and less on debt because equity gives more returns in a long run. \n\nI agree to that point but I don't want to take much risk for this. The only thing which I am doing as of now is that whenever I have some money left in a month I am investing lump sum in Debt mutual fund because I know that will never give me negative returns. And all the sip I have is of equity mutual fund to balance any negative returns. \n\nThus in the current scenario I know even if I will not get more returns my investment will not go in negative and also debt comes with an option of almost nil exit load that means even if I redeem my investment I don't have to pay any tax on it which is not the case in equity where you have to invest more than 3 years normally.\n\nWhat do you think is this the right strategy?","created":"August 29, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Why I am investing more in Debt than Equity","permlink":"why-i-am-investing-more-in-debt-than-equity","previous":{"title":"Duck Swimming in the Lake","permlink":"duck-swimming-in-the-lake"},"next":{"title":"Spotted Common Pigeon","permlink":"spotted-common-pigeon"}}}}
