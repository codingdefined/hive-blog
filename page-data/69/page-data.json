(photos + video)","author":"sweetsssj","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"travel-with-me-75-saying-hello-to-sharks-stingrays-sawfish-at-the-predator-lagoon-photos-video","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\n\n![IMG_9860.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdtN6NxZUbzSUzwKRnx1XiuiiY3vn5ExpfMpc2QEjjJUV/IMG_9860.jpg)\n\nOne of the things that made Atlantis stand out to me was their incredible Marine life diversity. As we've seen from our adventures to [The Dig](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-70-the-dig-at-the-lost-city-of-atlantis), this little island resort is the home of a huge array of aquatic life.  Indeed, the hotel and more specifically ***The Dig*** is the largest open air Marine Aquarium in the whole world. \n\nA simple stroll around Atlantis will reveal just how diverse the marine life is, not only that, you get a sense of how well the exhibits are integrated into the very foundations of the hotel. \n\nIn today's edition of *travel with me*, we'll be visiting a lesser known part of Atlantis, known as the ***Predator Lagoon***. Although it doesn't feature very much beside the more popular attractions such as ***The Dig*** and the ***Aquaventure Water Park***, it is certainly no less amazing. \n\n![predatorlagoon.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSDJFdL34ba2tiyMFwoMtqReG3zuWVG8TLtyZg1SH4LXF/predatorlagoon.png)\n\nFrom the ***Royal Towers***, you can actually follow a path on the edge of the hotel, all the way to Predator Lagoon. It takes about 15 minutes and you'll have some terrific views of the vicinity along the way. \n\nOur destination is the circular building with the seashell roof labelled *Lagoon Bar & Grill*.  In the above map, you can see it is adjacent to a beautiful sea connected lagoon called ***Paradise Lagoon*** which is one of the best places to swim in natural sea water. (As opposed to the other swimming pools at *Aquaventure*)\n\nBelow, you can see the *Lagoon Bar and Grill* with its very distinctive seashell roof, and a lovely view of the Paradise lagoon. Because the lagoon is connected directly to the sea, there are many fishes in the lagoon which have settled around the natural reefs and plantations. It is a really nice place to do some light snorkelling or paddle boating.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cqX3FF/DSC01014.jpg\n\nThis is a view of the [Casino](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-73-a-look-at-the-atlantis-casino-from-a-non-gambler) from the outside near the Predator Lagoon. Although not as formidable looking as the Royal Towers, it certainly commands it's own presence, especially with the waterfalls which themselves, circulate water from the dock side of the sea, to the paradise lagoon. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/graqvF/DSC01034.jpg\n\nTogether with the Royal Towers, it's simply an amazing view. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jy5qvF/DSC01023.jpg\n\nJust to give you an idea of the scale of the Casino building, this is me sitting on the ledge with the waterfalls only just out of the picture. I look so small!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jwSQCv/IMG_9867.jpg\n\nCan you see the Casino building on the left? That's where I sat on the ledge! Doesn't look that big from a distance, especially beside the Royal Towers.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gDtbKa/IMG_9866.jpg\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Atlantis hotel has the largest open air marine aquarium in the world. Here are some of the interesting creatures I saw on my way to Predator lagoon!\n\n***Sea Turtles***. Atlantis supports the conservation of sea turtles through their *\"Sea Turtles Conservancy Tour de Turtles\"* program.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wNidzhL.gif\n\nI was amazed to see so many Saw-fish in the shallow pools.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nqYAea/IMG_7698.jpg\n\nThere were actually quite a number of these saw-fish. \n\nAtlantis is the first zoological facility in the world to have successful births of the critically endangered small-tooth Saw-fish. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Qtq3k3w.gif\n\nThere are also hundreds of Cownose stingrays in their shallow lagoon. During the day, people can snorkel with them or even feed them!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/toKE1Mu.gif\n\nThese are some shots of the fish at The Dig from the outside. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dh5epa/DSC00943.jpg\n\nAt night, the lights turn on, and the shoals of fish become like moving silhouettes.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fiDeNv/DSC00941.jpg\n\nI love how they form these circular vortex's.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/faiPpa/DSC00936.jpg\n\nHow could I forget the cute little feral kittens running about the place.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/m1xmKa/IMG_8139.jpg\n\n### Predator Lagoon\n\nAfter a lovely walk outside, we finally arrive at the Lagoon Bar and Grill which is the building behind me with the seashell roof. The *Predator Lagoon* is located right beneath it so a good idea is to grab a bite to eat and then proceed to the exhibit below.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/w0YP0hd.gif\n\nThe underside of the roof has magnificent artwork depicting many many of the creatures that inhabit Atlantis. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/d5mkUa/DSC01035.jpg\n\nA walk down the spiral staircase and we're in the Predator lagoon! \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BJAafbK.gif\n\nOnce we reach the bottom, we're treated to an absolute feast of gorgeous marine life. Hundreds of different kinds of fish swimming around, chasing each other's tails.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/maYAea/15_AF72_EB_EACA_4_D15_B384_57_FBB3_B123_D8.jpg\n\nSome of the fish are ginormous. You'll find various kinds of sharks, barracuda's and tarpons to name a few. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mZsssv/IMG_9864.jpg\n\nLarge shoals of fish swimming in near unison can be seen through the crystal clear glass.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kEfnYSg.gif\n\nThere's also quite a number of large Stingrays. They are so impressive as they glide through the water with their wings propelling them forward. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/micTFF/DSC00237.jpg\n\nUp close, you can get a sense of how large they really are.  It's also a great opportunity to see their underside as usually we can only see them from the top. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iqRkCv/9_D621_BC3_2_A69_43_C1_85_D6_8_F20_DBFC0774.jpg\n\nI'm not sure why the fishes make this vortex formation. But it is remarkable to see.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cQpiza/E872_E937_9_A4_F_48_C3_817_B_C5497_B2_DDC13.jpg\n\nBelow are some of the other varieties of tropical fish you can expect to see here. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cdeuNv/DSC01128.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/km4Thv/DSC01053.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/h2Vepa/DSC01052.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/haFCsv/IMG_9865.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/c5MxaF/DSC01051.jpg\n\n### The Tunnel\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the Predator Lagoon and indeed any Aquarium, is the *Tunnel*. \n\nIt's a visual beauty as well as a treat to see Stingrays, Sharks, Saw-fish and lots of other fish swim over your head.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k5Ns9a/DSC01084.jpg\n\nI was in the tunnel for quite a while because I wanted to catch a photo of the big saw-fish swimming over. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gWPiza/IMG_9863.jpg\n\nIn case you didn't know, the saw-fish is often mistaken for being a Shark because of it's top down profile being very similar to sharks. Sometimes they are referred to as carpenter sharks because of their saw-like rostrum which is the primary tool they use to unearth buried crustaceans (their primary diet). \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/byz5Cv/IMG_9862.jpg\n\nSawfishes are actually classified as Rays.  And like rays, the Sawfish's mouth and nose are flat on the underside. \n\nI really like how they look from the bottom. Their mouths make them look like they're perpetually grinning!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iOWkUa/DSC01083.jpg\n\n### Be sure to check out the video!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QuFSZ48eyNs\n\n<hr>\n\nAnd that wraps up our visit to the *Predator Lagoon* at Atlantis. Even though it's not as popular as ***The Dig***, it's definitely a hidden gem. Sure you get to see Stingrays and Sawfish in the open air aquarium, this is the place to go if you want to see them up close. \n\nHope you enjoyed my post!\n\nAs always, If you liked my post, please upvote it, if you want to see more then follow me, and please leave a comment to let me know what you think! \n\n<hr>\n\n今天我想继续带大家探索这个大到一天走不完的亚特兰蒂斯酒店，这个占地占了整个天堂岛一大半的酒店，里面可谓是藏着都是宝。其实我坚持选择来到这家酒店的最大原因，就是酒店各处都住着难得一见的海洋动物，了解我的人应该知道我最大爱好是[照顾小动物](https://steemit.com/cats/@sweetsssj/just-kitty-raising-kittens-from-birth-the-joys-of-being-a-crazy-cat-lady)，各种各样漂亮的海洋生物也是我从小到大一直的最爱。在这家酒店里，只要是有水，有水池的地方，里面就有鱼，这也变成了一个最为吸引人的独特卖点，在全世界都很难找到第二个遍地都养着鱼的酒店。所以虽然这家酒店价格上有些残酷，但是我咬了咬牙，十几个小时飞到巴哈马，如果错失了和海洋生物住在一起的机会，那就太遗憾了。\n\n今天就请大家跟我一起好好探索一下住在酒店各处的鱼兄弟们。去看海洋生物的路上，要经过眼前这片像海水一般蔚蓝的天堂湖，一层层台阶上的水流下去汇成了小瀑布流进天堂湖。中午的时候有人在湖上游船，不过应该很晒。远看这个小瀑布像是从建筑里流出来的，主楼附近的建筑都很统一风格，非常喜欢这种桔粉色的色调，又豪华又复古，带着阵阵忧伤，毕竟主题是失落了的帝国。我爬上建筑坐在边缘，身下就是天堂湖，不知道万一失足掉下去是否就碰见鲨鱼哥了，所以拍照的时候心情很忐忑，生怕没坐稳摔下去，好在用绳命换来了很酷的照片，这个画面可是我自己diy的。走进这片水池，最先游来的是漂亮的海龟，我第一次见到纹路这么漂亮的海龟，这家酒店还建立一个项目专门帮助海龟慢慢适应自然的环境，最终放生，多么有意义的项目。接下来游到我身边的是sawfish锯鳐，这大概是我第一次看到这种鱼的品种。我好激动，之前只听说这家酒店到处都可以见到鱼，但没有想到都是些这么稀有的鱼品种。这种鱼身体平扁，有点像锯鲨目的鲨鱼。好喜欢它银灰色的肤色，在太阳照射下闪闪发光非常性感。我感慨，比起一般的鱼，这种鱼好大好长。听说有的锯鳐身长可达5米，平时喜欢把身体埋在泥沙中。锯鳐主要生活在浅海，所以可以看到这个池水真的好浅，好适合它居住。它主要生活在世界各地的暖水海洋中，是国际濒危灭绝的鱼类，想到这家酒店能找来这么多肯定费了不少功夫，希望他们能好好善待这些鱼，帮助它们摆脱濒危灭绝得困境。锯鳐主要以海底甲壳类动物为生，所以看下面这个gif，这么大一只龙虾走过来，看到这三条怪鱼都后退了，特别搞笑。\n\n接下来看到的是黄貂鱼的小宝宝，它们又叫魔鬼鱼，是一种与鲨鱼有近亲缘关系的鳐鱼。从大约1.8亿的远古时代繁衍至今，黄貂鱼和鲨鱼也是唯一的2种古代软骨鱼。小宝宝游起来的速度好快，身体像没有长骨头特别柔韧，还挥舞着像蝴蝶一样的翅膀。酒店池水里的鱼大多可以从陆地上和地下宫殿观看，不同的视角会有不同的感触。现在我们就深入天堂湖旁边的捕食者池，走进地下近距离观察一下这些可爱的海洋生物吧。地宫下有一段拱形的海底隧道，这里有各种品种的鱼，鲨鱼，大黄貂鱼，还有好长好大的锯鳐从我头顶游过，记录下了这个美妙的瞬间。希望大家喜欢对于海洋生物的探索，之后还有更多有趣的内容在等着和大家分享。","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"travel\",\"life\",\"photography\",\"blog\",\"cn\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmdtN6NxZUbzSUzwKRnx1XiuiiY3vn5ExpfMpc2QEjjJUV\\/IMG_9860.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSDJFdL34ba2tiyMFwoMtqReG3zuWVG8TLtyZg1SH4LXF\\/predatorlagoon.png\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cqX3FF\\/DSC01014.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/graqvF\\/DSC01034.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/jy5qvF\\/DSC01023.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/jwSQCv\\/IMG_9867.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/gDtbKa\\/IMG_9866.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/wNidzhL.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/nqYAea\\/IMG_7698.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/Qtq3k3w.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/toKE1Mu.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/dh5epa\\/DSC00943.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/fiDeNv\\/DSC00941.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/faiPpa\\/DSC00936.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/m1xmKa\\/IMG_8139.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/w0YP0hd.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/d5mkUa\\/DSC01035.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/BJAafbK.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/maYAea\\/15_AF72_EB_EACA_4_D15_B384_57_FBB3_B123_D8.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/mZsssv\\/IMG_9864.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/kEfnYSg.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/micTFF\\/DSC00237.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/iqRkCv\\/9_D621_BC3_2_A69_43_C1_85_D6_8_F20_DBFC0774.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cQpiza\\/E872_E937_9_A4_F_48_C3_817_B_C5497_B2_DDC13.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cdeuNv\\/DSC01128.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/km4Thv\\/DSC01053.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/h2Vepa\\/DSC01052.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/haFCsv\\/IMG_9865.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/c5MxaF\\/DSC01051.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/k5Ns9a\\/DSC01084.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/gWPiza\\/IMG_9863.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/byz5Cv\\/IMG_9862.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/iOWkUa\\/DSC01083.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/QuFSZ48eyNs\\/0.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-70-the-dig-at-the-lost-city-of-atlantis\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-73-a-look-at-the-atlantis-casino-from-a-non-gambler\",\"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/QuFSZ48eyNs\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/cats\\/@sweetsssj\\/just-kitty-raising-kittens-from-birth-the-joys-of-being-a-crazy-cat-lady\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a1218f45-0041-5d8d-a7ae-ad297e81be47","title":"How to become rich ?","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"how-to-become-rich","body":"*“To become rich, you have to be making money while you’re asleep.”*- David Bailey\n\n**Spend less, Save more**\n\nThe golden rule to become rich is start saving as much as possible. Simply saving a small amount monthly can help you collect huge sum over time. Now you must be thinking how to do it? I would suggest start with saving the extra money you spend unnecessarily on privileges. One of the best ways to fulfill your desired goal is to distribute your salaried amount into expense heads. For instance, one can divide the salary into 4 broad categories, that include: 30% on house and food expense, 30% for lifestyle, 20% for savings and another 20% for debts/credits/loans etc. Once you get into a habit of saving, you can steadily increase the portion of your savings each month.\n\n**Know your goals**\n\nVisualize your Financial Goals to become rich. Planning your finances can not only grow your money, but serve as a major support as well all times of your life. It is important to set financial goals regardless of the age. You can target your goals systematically by dividing it into time frames, that are- short-term, mid-term and long-term. This categorizing of goals gives a realistic approaching to your financial goals. so, start setting goals & take a first step towards your savings journey.\n\n**Have a Investment Plan**\n\nWhen you are prepared with an Investment Plan, it not only helps you stay safe during bad times but also ensures you reach the desired corpus. Once you know the benefits of a financial plan, you can easily set your financial goals. Create your financial plan here- Fincash.com\n\n**Make a Wise Investment**\n\nOver the years, as you start investing you realize the growth of your money. Typically, investments grow over time and so does the money. For example, the value of Rs. 500 does not remain same in next 5 years (if invested) and it grows over time! Therefore, investing is very essential for everyone. It’s easy! There are various Investment Options in India like Mutual Funds, Fixed Income Instruments, etc.\n\n**Say NO to Debt**\n\nDebt is a big NO when it comes to becoming rich. In order to save money and become rich, it is suggested to remain debt free throughout. What’s the point of becoming rich if your entire money is not your possession?\n\n**Remember: High Risk = High Returns**\n\nIn order to become rich, one has to invest in instruments that offer good returns. But, it is important to understand with high returns comes high risk as well. So, if you wish to save more for your future, you need to invest in high risk instruments like equity funds. There are various other investments that offer high returns.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"money\",\"investment\",\"steemit\",\"rich\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"733aba9f-6986-5c11-951a-4151cd4ec850","title":"Beautiful India #6 - Mountains in Kodaikanal","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"beautiful-india-5-mountains-in-kodaikanal","body":"I will be adding a lot of Images of Beautiful Indian Places.

Many of us could not accomplish this. No matter how hard we tried, we would not be able to create steemit. That does not matter much now though, because steemit already exists. Since it does exist, now *we* get the chance to ***make*** it. \n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>MAKING STEEMIT</center>\n\n--------------\nNow that steemit exists, we do have the chance to make it. Each member of this community can contribute to it, and it is our combined efforts that will make steemit what it will be, and they are currently making steemit what it is. So then, exactly what are we making it.\n\nThis post will touch on subjects covered by other steemians, and is written as a way for me to gather some thoughts and share some ideas about some recent trends affecting (or perhaps even *infecting* steemit.)\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n## <center>THE OLD GUY STARTS TALKING ABOUT \"BACK IN THE DAY\" AGAIN</center>\n\n----------\nBack in the day, when I was still new around here, things were not even close to as nice as they are now. Please fully understand that before you go any further. There were less whales to go around, no delegated voting power, no curation guilds, and the vast majority of votes from your average users were more or less *completely worthless*, at least as far as dollar value is concerned.  It took me many, many months to ever have a full power upvote be worth more than 1 cent. Now, rather new users are throwing around nickels or more. \n\nTrust me, newer users on steemit have *no idea* how good they have it. Yet, many do not want to invest much, they just want to get paid. Those who do get paid want to get paid *more.* (I write this in direct response to no one, just as an attempt to discuss a current trend.) Even though nowhere else on the internet has ever paid these users for any of their efforts, making a few cents as a new user is not enough for them. Trust me, I know the feeling of having a lot of work not get noticed much.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>AN EXAMPLE FROM PAPA-PEPPER</center>\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://s14.postimg.org/4wegwzkvl/blight.jpg\n\nEven after almost three months on the platform, I had posts periodically not make very much. I did a wonderful post about scorpions in blacklights, and it made 54 cents total, of which my portion was 43 cents.\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://s11.postimg.org/vmgpcpjir/IMG_20160901_095317141.jpg\n\nI had even taken a selfie with a live scorpion unrestrained in my hand, just to prove it was original work. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/jKlth0_HkDA\n\nI made an original video to include demonstrating how I pick up scorpions without getting stung.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BKpl4pjxHKk\n\nI made another video showing how scorpions glow under a blacklight to show people that the photos were not edited.\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://s14.postimg.org/ps0r88h2p/20160831_204551.jpg\n\nAnd I included cool, original photos like this one above. You can check out the post [here](https://steemit.com/photography/@papa-pepper/blacklight-scorpion-unedited-and-awesome) to see what I am talking about. Sure I was still learning, but the point is that I was taking a lot of time to make original content that was consistently of a decent quality.\n\nSo, when I saw that my post was going to be \"undervalued\" how did I respond? Did I spam link every user on steemit? Did I make 100 comments on trending posts saying \"I upvoted you, PLEASE UPVOTE ME?\" Of course not. I went about making my next post to the best of my ability. In fact, if I remember right, [this was my next post](https://steemit.com/gardening/@papa-pepper/why-the-best-time-ever-to-be-a-gardener-is-now) and it paid out at 82 cents total. It was just another original post full of my own photos and writing. Still, who else was ever willing to give me 82 cents for some photos and paragraphs? No, that only happened to me on steemit, and I moved forward again as I always did.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n## <center>COMMENTING</center>\n\n----------\nMultiple times on steemit I have mentioned that when you show up on steemit, no one really knows that you are here. Unless you get out and comment on some posts, you are unlikely to meet others, make friends, gain followers, and gain support. I never really used commenting as a *tactic*, but upon reflection, I made the suggestion to others, because I believe that it works.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/524JEGf.png\n\nThis illustration is *NOT* what I meant by making comments. So many users seem to only use this method. When I look at a post with 20 comments and half of them are people *begging* for votes and followers, it looks **really lame.** How do you think that this looks to the rest of the world online? They are free to check out our posts and read our comments.\n\nPersonally, I have upvoted and followed people who have left replies like this. I figure that there is a learning curve for newer users and that I should cut them some slack. However, if they feel that this method works, what will stop them from continuing? For this reason, I've pretty much stopped responding to those comments.\n\nWhen someone leaves an actual, thoughtful comment on one of my posts, I often will check out who they are and what they are up to. I'll upvote and follow users who leave comments like rather than the vote-beggars every time. It amazes me that some people will even leave comments like \"tansks for the good post, upvote and folow me for relly good posts please.\" Trust me, that will *not* work.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>MAKING INTRODUCTIONS</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1iTlSFG.png\n\nOf course an \"introduceyourself\" post is the way to introduce yourself to the community, but when you comment on someone else's post, this is actually *you introducing yourself to that user.* If the first thing that you tell someone when you meet them is \"upvote me,\" it becomes **very obvious** that you *do not care about that person as much as what you can get from them.* Basically, you are telling them, \"Let me use you!\"\n\nIf we step outside of the steemit realm and take a walk offline, I think that we can paint this picture in a different hue to help you understand. Imagine walking up to a stranger and immediately asking, \"*Can I have $3.00?*\" I'm not sure how many of you would actually do this in real life, but if you wouldn't do it on the street, perhaps you shouldn't do it on steemit. Also, if you would do it in real life, perhaps you should stop. (That is just a suggestion.)\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>PAY TO PLAY - THE VOTE-BEGGARS TURN VOTE-BUYERS</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6YFcHpG.png\n\nYes, recently there has been the growing trend of selling upvotes. I completely understand that from a business point of view, this approach makes a lot of cents (sense). For the voter, they are getting even more than just curation rewards for their votes, and their votes aren't really costing them anything. For the vote-buyer, they are getting a good return on their investment. Often, their investment (money spend on buying the vote) can more than double. Wouldn't you give someone $1.00 if they were to give you $2.00 in return? Eventually, you'd be rich if you kept that up.\n\nHowever, in a scenario like selling upvotes, some things just do not matter at all, like quality or originality. These two key factors used to play a *huge role* in getting noticed here. Yes, the content creators would have to invest (or \"waste\" if you prefer) a lot a great content to get noticed and consistently supported. Without the great, original, quality content, it is hard to gain a following and get some good payouts, but often that means that a lot of good content does not get good payouts while a user is trying to get noticed and gain support. (Trust me, I've been there, and done that.)\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dVnfFVj.png\n\nObviously, steemit as a platform and as a community continues to change over time. Whether it improves or not is up to us. I'd rather not be in a community of greedy beggars. Please take note of these things that I have constantly said over the last year:\n\n-----------\n* ### NO ONE OWES YOU ANYTHING\n* ### STEEMIT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY, NOT A GUARANTEE\n\n-------------\nIf you want to take advantage of the opportunity that steemit offers, keep in mind that you may not get a return on your investment. It may never \"pay off\" for you. It may never \"pay off *enough*\" for you either. If you try, you *could* succeed, and if you **quit** then I can guarantee that you will not. It is that simple.\n\nNo one here is entitled to anything. Truthfully, we may not even deserve the opportunity that steemit offers. Dan did not have to create steemit, and steemit did not have to *give* you a *free* account. \n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>ADVICE FROM PAPA</center>\n\n-----------\nIf you want to try to earn something from your time on steemit, do not ask others to follow or upvote you. I've made almost 22,000 comments and posts on steemit, and I have (to the best of my knowledge) *never* commented on someone else's post begging them to follow or upvote me. If I can manage to make tens of thousands of comments without begging maybe you are capable of the same.\n\nActually *interact* with others and even try to *care* about them, instead of just caring about yourself and your wallet. Don't just run around on other people's post asking them to give. (They don't even know you.)\n\nSpeaking of not knowing others. I'd recommend the same thing for private chats. I have plenty of people that I chat with in private, but I'd recommend not spam-linking others in private chats. Sure, I've cut some people come slack and I've given out some upvotes, but others may flag you for doing so. \n\nI actually had one user tell me to \"give them some Steem Power\" in a private chat. I had not previously met this user and was curious, so I asked them what they meant. They then told me to \"give them some STEEM or SBD\" so that they could power it up. Yeah, someone really said that. To tell you the truth, I did not give away my hard-earned STEEM to them just to help them power up. Would anyone?\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>THE COMMUNITY IN MY MIND</center>\n\n-------\nThere is a steemit in my mind, and it is a steemit that I am *laboring* to create in reality. It is a community of generous, talented people interacting with one another, collaborating with one another, and helping one another. It is a community of people that actually care about one another and are willing to listen and help one another. It is a community of individuals that realize they can accomplish more by working *together* than they ever could alone. It is a positive community of encouraging individuals that is attractive to those on the outside and able to entice them into joining. This is the community that I already exist in, and for me, it starts on my page and spreads out from there.\n\n## <center>THE CHOICE IS YOURS</center>\n\n---------------\nI am officially inviting you to join in on making steemit the community that it should be. Many of you *already* are. No one has to, and if need be, I will exist in a parallel universe on steemit that operates on a different mentality and philosophy than the greedy beggars. Hopefully though, we can still steer this community the right way.\n\nFor the record, if you spam-link or vote-beg in the comment sections of my posts, I will not flag you, but I will also not upvote you. If you would like me to personally check out your most recent post, then just read my post and leave a real comment that may catch my attention. Perhaps I'll make my way over to your page. Perhaps not, as I am only one man. I currently have just over 30% voting power, but I vote when and where I can. \n\n----------\n> ### I DON'T RANT OFTEN, BUT WHEN IT DO, I TRY TO HAVE A POINT. \n> ### - @papa-pepper\n\n--------------------\nTrust me, I do care about all of you, and @papa-pepper does want to help. However, I cannot provide all that you need. No one can. Sometimes you have to put in a lot of hard work and effort to get something in return. Sometimes, you get nothing return. That is reality, and that is where I live. Stop by any time you want. Thanks everyone! Be blessed.\n\n---------\n-------\n#### <center>Until next time…</center>\n## <center>Don’t waste your time online, *invest* it with steemit.com</center>\n\n\n-------------\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmWJLBUEQKrsCFYNSpzTSiRPbR8AT45ZpwbjgCX5ucQaDN/image.png\n### <center>[TO TRANSLATE POSTS VIA OPERATION TRANSLATION CLICK HERE](https://steemit.com/translation/@papa-pepper/operation-translation-now-under-construction-what-it-is-and-how-you-can-help)</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemit\",\"community\",\"upvote\",\"follow\",\"life\"],\"users\":[\"dantheman\",\"papa-pepper\"],\"image\":[\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/TCBRdhp.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img1.steemit.com\\/0x0\\/http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/uVNBbyL.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/0x0\\/https:\\/\\/s14.postimg.org\\/4wegwzkvl\\/blight.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/0x0\\/https:\\/\\/s11.postimg.org\\/vmgpcpjir\\/IMG_20160901_095317141.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/jKlth0_HkDA\\/0.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/BKpl4pjxHKk\\/0.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/0x0\\/https:\\/\\/s14.postimg.org\\/ps0r88h2p\\/20160831_204551.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/524JEGf.png\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/1iTlSFG.png\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/6YFcHpG.png\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/dVnfFVj.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/0x0\\/https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmWJLBUEQKrsCFYNSpzTSiRPbR8AT45ZpwbjgCX5ucQaDN\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/jKlth0_HkDA\",\"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/BKpl4pjxHKk\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/photography\\/@papa-pepper\\/blacklight-scorpion-unedited-and-awesome\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/gardening\\/@papa-pepper\\/why-the-best-time-ever-to-be-a-gardener-is-now\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/translation\\/@papa-pepper\\/operation-translation-now-under-construction-what-it-is-and-how-you-can-help\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e37d2877-2b23-547d-80d5-d5ba794e2ad7","title":"A Massive Thank You for Helping Me Reach the \"1000 Followers\" Milestone / 我的Steemit历程","author":"rea","created":"July 05, 2017","permlink":"a-massive-thank-you-for-helping-me-reach-the-1000-followers-milestone-steemit-1000","body":"<h2>Woohoo!</h2> \n\nI’m so excited and totally over the moon about reaching this significant milestone of over *1000* followers! It’s coming up to a year since my husband first told me about Steemit and curiosity got the better of me. Up until that point, I had barely heard of **Bitcoin** and the word **“crypto”** may as well have been something in another language. But Steemit was the catalyst to me discovering one of the best things I’ve ever come across in my life.\n\nWithin that short period of time *(coming up to exactly one year now)*, I can honestly say that this incredible website has changed me as a person. Brought out aspects of my personality I didn’t know existed before. I would never have considered myself an extrovert. Quite the opposite, in fact. But the confidence and drive this great platform has produced in me is nothing short of a modern-day marvel.\n\nThe people I’ve connected with during my time on Steemit has been a wonderous experience. More so even via Steemfest was such a magnificent event. I’m sure the next one will somehow prove to be even better. Catching up with established friends as well as creating new ones. *Can’t wait!*\n\nI find it almost impossible to believe it has only been one year since I joined this amazing platform. It feels like it’s been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, lol. So, anyways, I thought what better way to celebrate then share with you some of my most unforgettable times on Steemit and reminisce the mind-blowing journey I’ve had on the Steemit platform.\n\n*Here are some of my Steemit Hightlights:*\n<hr>\n\n[<h2><center>\"Introducing Steemit Into The World Of Hollywood\"</center></h2>](https://steemit.com/steemit/@rea/introducing-steemit-into-the-world-of-hollywood)\n\nIt’s amazing how long ago it feels but the post was actually created round about this time last year. *And a little fun fact for anyone new to the platform now is that the “big earning” posters at the time were all about promoting Steemit and getting the word out.* One girl setting off loads of balloons with “Steemit” written on them, billboards displaying the Steemit logo, interviews on the street and, of course, that famous **“Make-Up”** tutorial.\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\nhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmYEGoUDvWCcN6HCWYHx4eZPf6hUno4SUfGxPx1kz48uFz/2017-07-05%2009.25.34.jpg\n</div>\n\nSo, I thought I’d have a go since I was a big television and comic book steemian fan who happened to have tickets for the [LFCC](http://www.londonfilmandcomiccon.com) that month! To prepare, I got myself a pair of “Steemit” t-shirts *(a big deal at the time)* down at a shop called Snappy Snaps and attended the event the following day. Now, while hardly anyone there was actually willing to listen about what Steemit was *(a lot has changed since then, lol!)*, my goal was to photobomb as many celebs as I could, bearing my “Steemit” logo. I think I did alright considering how crowded the venue was and the amount of queuing involved. \n\nI met a few “Game of Thrones” stars as well as **Jon Heder** from **Napoleon Dynamite** and **Blades of Glory** *(God, I love that movie!)*. But the cream of the crop was going to be **Jeremy Renner** from **Marvel’s The Avengers**! But unfortunately, they didn’t allow any publisizing of any kind *(including logos on shirts)*, so they just snapped us with together from just above our necks and cropped the rest out! I was so disappointed, I can’t tell you how much! But all’s well that end’s well and after numerous posts of mine that didn’t really get much attention, this was the first to garner proper recognition. *It was an amazing feeling and one I hope everyone on Steemit gets to experience!*<hr>    \n\n[<h2><center>\"How Steemit Has Introduced Me Into the World of Crypto\"</center></h2>](https://steemit.com/steemit/@rea/how-steemit-has-introduced-me-into-the-world-of-crypto-steemit)\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\nhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmULiNNhPaHjqAiMNpfBriSayKYPrhXgPHAv7kvgyNwQgM/2017-07-05%2009.26.59.jpg\n</div>\n\nI’m sure many of you on Steemit can completely relate to this particular one! Because this was exactly just the fact of the matter. *I knew next to NOTHING about anything crypto, period!* My husband mentioned Bitcoin a few times before but I’d just switch off and go do something else which I thought actually “mattered.” \n\n**Boy, how Steemit changed all that.**\n\nIn the article I posted, it summed up my transformation from being a total cynic to now talking about pretty much nothing else, lol! **How I’ve changed over the last year!** One of the key aspects at the time was Steemit’s bridging of the two mega powerhouses. *Crypto and social media.* All done by adding that well-established “$” sign to every post, thereby giving the platform value that anybody could instantly relate to. *A stroke of genius if you ask me, lol!*\n\nI chronicled my journey up until where I was at the time and highlighted that “Matrix “ moment I had experienced. Because of Steemit, I actually started using Bitcoin. *I mean, shouldn’t that have been the other way around?* But yes, I was having such an awesome time and on such a high that I had to let the world know how “great” I was feeling. So I wrote a post about it. And the best thing is because it’s transformed so many other steemian’s lives from that point on until now, many more people can understand and embrace that same “high” that I was on too!<hr>     \n\n[<h2><center>\"The First Steemit USB Giveaway at the EGX 2016\"</center></h2>](https://steemit.com/steemit/@rea/the-first-steemit-usb-giveaway-at-the-egx-2016)\n\nThis one was more of a personal project than anything else and I worked quite hard on it! In regards to promoting Steemit, I figured instead of simply getting people’s pictures taken or handing out leaflets, I’d attempt to spread the word using something that has an actual **“real world use”** and would likely be kept with that individual because of it. *After all, familiarity creates brand awareness, right?* So, I  came up with an idea. Imprint the “Steemit” logo onto a set of portable USB sticks and hand them out in exchange for the individuals e-mail and personal details. *Didn’t seem a bad idea at all!*\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\nhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmX7YbUHYSzjzWtsuyjrzPneG7CUSvJFwGq1q2oJo72uUT/2017-07-05%2009.25.46.jpg\n</div>\n\nBut, I did have something of a **wake-up** call. I actually didn’t mention this in the post itself, but my initial strategy was to carry out my plan in London’s **China Town!** Not only that, but also try to get people to sign up there and then via their Facebook account! Needless to say, that ended up a disaster, lol. The people just weren’t interested with only one couple at least listening to my sales pitch before saying goodbye!\n\nWell, as luck would have it, my husband was going to the **EGX 2016** *(A games and tech show featuring all the latest gadgets and software launches.)* **This seemed the perfect opportunity!** So, yes, I went there albeit with a slightly different strategy this time around. *Handing out the USB’s in exchange for their name and e-mail address.* And I did just that, with the blog I created afterwards chronicling the whole thing.\n\nWell, sadly only a handful of them got back to me. But now looking back, that was only to be expected. The whole *“crypto”* and *“blockchain”* thing wasn’t nearly as exposed as it is now. Had it been this year’s event, the end result may have been very different indeed. However, the core idea of a tangible, useful item baring the “Steemit” logo being dispersed to a number of potential steemians was completed. *I just hope they remember where they got it from when Steemit goes to the moon!*\n\n<hr>  \n\n[<h2><center>\"Steemfest I\"</center></h2>](https://steemit.com/steemfest/@rea/uniting-steemians-through-the-delight-of-the-steemfest)\n\n\n**Ah! The very first Steemfest!** \n\nIf ever there was a time I can look back with the fondest of memories, it’s that incredible event. I know for a fact it still astounds those that attended at how awesome and well-organised the whole experience was. **From the speakers to the structured city-based activities to the delicious food provided.** *It was unbelievable from start to finish*. @roelandp achieved legendary status on Steemit after that and rightly so!\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\">\nhttps://steemitimages.com/DQmdMFDZcpVoAZHXXEKnSy2wKDTx1dPAiFxzbufqPDFbuCV/2017-07-05%2009.25.22.jpg\n</div>\n\nAs for the fest itself, it’s something you had to have been there to fully comprehend. All these steemians wearing small tags around their neck displaying what their **“username”** is. All those articles I read and enjoyed, now knowing who the faces were behind the blog *(This was before user profiles were introduced)*. It was as surreal as you could get. A completely unforgettable time that I still spend thinking about many times over.\n\nWhich leads us to **Steemfest II**. I remember clearly how everybody at the end of the first Steemfest told @roelandp. *“Take a good rest”, “Put your feet up”!* **I mean, nobody expected him to organise another one!** But lo and behold, that is exactly what he has done. **What an amazing guy!** And if the last fest was anything to go by, everyone who attends will be in for the time of their lives. \n\n<center>**I absolutely cannot wait. Roll on, November 1st!**</center>\n\n<center>\n![ScreenShot2016-11-15at10.23.52AMb0955.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUrN31BpxXefy34a2mNc9z9Sdm7HaKWzJPgmbnH7kXLWc/ScreenShot2016-11-15at10.23.52AMb0955.png)\n</center><hr>\n\n<h1><center>And A Big Thank You To…</center></h1>\n\nEveryone who I’ve come into contact with on Steemit has been such a jpy and pleasure. When people say there’s a community within the Steemit eco-verse, they’re not wrong at all. The friendly comments, the great posts and the overall experience of being a steemian is something I cherish and hold very dear to my heart. \n\nI signed up and started blogging back in June 2016. Way less users back then but through the **“tagging”** system, you could easily find the content you wanted to view. That’s when I came across the **“CN”** tag. A small group of Chinese steemians had managed to set up a tiny group within the small community itself. Headed up by the great **@abit**, he was the first one who gave me a warm welcome on my **“Introduction”** post I created under the tag.

New users\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-AccountsNew.png\n\nThis chart shows the number of newly registered users on Steemit and how many of them became active. We see that a lot of accounts are registered, but never used.\n\nWarning: this graphic is kind of dynamic! A user can register one day and become a few days later. Therefore, the number of active users on a specific date may change from day to day.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Accounts.png\n\nIn this graph, the orange line shows the total number of registered accounts.\nThe green line shows how many of them have been active at least once (by active, I mean those who made at least one post, comment or upvote). They are included even if they become inactive later.\n\n### 2. Post and comments\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts30.png\n\nThese graphs show the evolution of posts and comments for the whole blockchain lifetime and for the last 30 days. \n\n### 3.

This give you an idea of the whole activity on the blockchain.\n\n### 6. Categories\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Categories.png\n\nThis graph shows the tag has been the most used for publishing posts for the whole blockchain lifetime.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-CategoriesDay.png\n\nThis graph shows the tag has been the most used for publishing posts last day.\n\n### 7. Distribution\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Reputation.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the reputation among users. Accounts with a reputation lower than 25 have been removed to keep the graph readable.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Levels.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the voting power (it now includes the new \"Inactive\" and \"Red Fish\" levels - check  @steemitboard blog for more info about this).\n\n### 8.

That makes it harder to attack and more trustworthy since it is almost impossible (or getting to be) to carry out attacks which falsify transactions, double spending etc.\n\n<h3>2. Real world effort:</h3> A considerable amount of real world money, energy and infrastructure goes into mining it.  In a sense that creates a certain base level of value.\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![ThinkstockPhotos-510795912 (1).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVobwBxChibuC17tbH2azpbLNfr5cH9etP8AY2w9JmcA1/ThinkstockPhotos-510795912%20(1).jpg)\n<center>**Bitcoin is the primary gateway to other cryptocurrencies.**</center>\n</div>    \n\n<h3>3. Branding:</h3> Bitcoin is arguably the only cryptocurrency \"brand\" that has recognition in the real world.  \n\n<h3>4. Community:</h3> Bitcoin probably has the largest community backing - you would be hard pressed to find someone who is into cryptocurrencies who doesn't support it.\n\n<h3>5. Segwit 2X:</h3> It seems likely that Segwit 2X will now pass.  This won't solve the scaling issues forever but will help.\n\n<h3>6. Gateway to the Crypto World:</h3> Bitcoin is the primary gateway to all other cryptocurrency tokens and investments - and it will likely stay that way for some time.  If you have no other cryptocurrency and want to buy \"Token X\" you will in most cases need to buy Bitcoin first.\n\n<h3>7. Scarcity Without Some of the Disadvantages:</h3> Bitcoin is very scarce compared to most other cryptocurrencies and monetary systems.  Yes you can divide it up into tiny units without problems but that does not take account of how people psychologically deal with numbers.  \n\nFurther even at it's slowest, bitcoin is infinitely easier and faster to transport than commodities like gold.  \n\nYou can also secure it and hide it more easily than physical money or gold - reducing (but not eliminating) the risk of being robbed.\n___\n<center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>\n___\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![ThinkstockPhotos-187725838.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZVsDRYEgniykyUr2LUGYTvX45EvgnJQMpCuf3QnXKLKt/ThinkstockPhotos-187725838.jpg)\n<center> **IMO opinion the BTC value car has a long way to go!** </center>\n</div>\n\n<h3>It is very subjective as to whether you believe that the current valuation takes these factors into account or not (even assuming you do agree with them).</h3>\n\nOverall I think Bitcoin will be around for the foreseeable future.\n\n**From that perspective and with the limited total tokens (21m) simple demand will mean that valuations in the millions of dollars per token are feasible eventually.**\n\nThat is pure speculation on my part but I believe that it is within the bounds of possibility and given that it is so, it should have an impact on the current price too.\n\n**Feel free to share your own thoughts below.**\n___\n<center><h1>Thank you for reading</h1></center>\n___\n![ThinkstockPhotos-494400097.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT4XkxrBkc4djV4wK1g3xbneXNyyPkKiRaE3bPQuR6REf/ThinkstockPhotos-494400097.jpg)\n\n___\n___\n___\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n  \n[![Steemithelp.net](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmeE6JX9ueo5L2FzTXhwDKaVhTjtfEuV7TzTnDZ2S193aF/Screenshot%202017-05-14%2012.25.56.png)](https://www.steemithelp.net/)\n\n</div>  \n\n\n## <center>Are you new to Steemit and Looking for Answers?</center>\n\n#### <center>_Please visit:_</center>\n\n# <center>[Steemithelp.net](https://www.steemithelp.net)</center>\n\n#### <center>A collection of guides and tutorials that cover the basics of Steem and Steemit.</center>\n___\n###### <center> _Follow me [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@thecryptofiend) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Soul_Eater_43)._ </center> \n____\n<h6><center>_All uncredited images are taken from my personal [Thinkstock Photography](http://www.thinkstockphotos.co.uk/) account.
