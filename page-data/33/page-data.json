But unfortunately it is not the case for most part of the world. There are big cities where you get big buildings and have hardly any sign of trees. I also stay in a big city but whenever I get time I will escape to get some fresh air. \n\nRecently I was going out of the city where I have seen trees on both side of the Road, which makes travel so smooth and refreshing. I was wondering, if this can be done all over the world where we can plant trees on the road side which will help the environment big time.\n\n![IMG_20180101_160027.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNi3CyNHFWFhBswsvJbEjHbWB2Pcx5cdb5LEq7JXeCxMN/IMG_20180101_160027.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20180101_160029.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUqkSbXd8Ly6UJJhNAun8RZApcFMG3UD54RovsFJwrSKw/IMG_20180101_160029.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"smartphonephotography\",\"nature\",\"india\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmNi3CyNHFWFhBswsvJbEjHbWB2Pcx5cdb5LEq7JXeCxMN\\/IMG_20180101_160027.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmUqkSbXd8Ly6UJJhNAun8RZApcFMG3UD54RovsFJwrSKw\\/IMG_20180101_160029.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"39216d74-d326-5613-a4ea-e2d08582ead0","title":"Utopian Moderator Intro - CodingDefined","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 12, 2018","permlink":"utopian-moderator-intro-codingdefined","body":"I have been moderating Utopian.io Posts for quite sometime, but before starting moderation I was one of the early adapters of Utopian.io where I used to write Posts about Tutorials, Suggestions, Bug Reports as well as Development.

The problem with Microsoft tools was that it was only working with Windows and not cross platform. \n\nNow Microsoft also started creating tools for Cross Platform, one such example is SQL Server 2017 which is released for Linux. Similarly it has released MSSQL-CLI which is a cross-platform command line client for SQL Server which can be used in Linux, Mac or even Windows. \n\nTo get started you need to have Python installed on your system and then install the CLI using the PIP command as shown below :\n\n`pip install mssql-cli`\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515658183/rpobfc4gysiwoahaq8t4.png)\n\nOnce done you can check all the commands available using `mssql-cli --help`\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515658448/jjuqpndni8cw4wimn4zs.png)\n\nNext is to connect the Database and explore different features of MSSQL-CLI. For connecting to the database you need to run the command \n\n`mssql-cli -S YourServerName -E -d YourDatabaseName`\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515659701/onghnfk5xin0ldn4w1ta.png)\n\nNow some of the Important features are shown below of the MSSQL-CLI and they are Auto-completion and Syntax Highlighting with Green as shown below.\n\n<a href=\"https://cl.ly/0w0Q372W2X17\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://d2ffutrenqvap3.cloudfront.net/items/1t1h433q3I1L1V2c1F1M/Screen%20recording%202018-01-11%20at%2005.28.47%20PM.gif\" style=\"display: block;height: auto;width: 100%;\"/></a>\n\nOne more thing I have seen which can be seen in above GIF is that if you have written the command before it will take that command and show you in the current command if you would like to run it again.\n\nNow I feel it is a great advantage not only for the Mac or Linux user but also for the Windows user, one of the advantage is It is fast I can query and get the result in seconds and I can do a lot of stuff on the CLI itself.\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/mssql-cli-command-line-query-tool-for-sql-server\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"utopian\",\"app\":\"utopian\\/1.0.0\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"repository\":{\"id\":106766050,\"name\":\"mssql-cli\",\"full_name\":\"dbcli\\/mssql-cli\",\"html_url\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/dbcli\\/mssql-cli\",\"fork\":false,\"owner\":{\"login\":\"dbcli\"}},\"pullRequests\":[],\"platform\":\"github\",\"type\":\"tutorials\",\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"opensource\",\"steemdevs\",\"sqlserver\",\"programming\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515658183\\/rpobfc4gysiwoahaq8t4.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515658448\\/jjuqpndni8cw4wimn4zs.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515659701\\/onghnfk5xin0ldn4w1ta.png\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515658183\\/rpobfc4gysiwoahaq8t4.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515658448\\/jjuqpndni8cw4wimn4zs.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1515659701\\/onghnfk5xin0ldn4w1ta.png\"],\"moderator\":{\"account\":\"sedatyildiz\",\"flagged\":true,\"reviewed\":false,\"pending\":false}}"}},{"node":{"id":"279ff6b9-6363-55ed-a602-d7a46db19667","title":"Color Challenge - Thursday Green - View From Train","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 11, 2018","permlink":"color-challenge-thursday-green-view-from-train","body":"So recently I traveled from Bangalore to Kolkata by train which is approximately 2000 Kms distance and it takes close to 35 hours of train journey.

I am using Jenkins for building .Net projects and then deploying it on to the Dev, Stage and Prod Server. \nCreating a Job in Jenkins means creating Pipeline (Jenkins Pipeline) which is a combination of plugins used to create continuous flow of actions. \n\nFor Example : I will create a Jenkins Pipeline which will Build the .Net Project from Github and then deploy it to the Windows Server. For that I need to add a GitHub Plugin which will check if any new commits have been added or not, MSBuild plugin for building the .Net Project and the last is msdeploy for deploying the build to the server.\n\nThis is the small introduction of Jenkins and Jenkins Pipeline. So I am the admin of the jenkins server and we have Jenkins Security, so that I can only run the pipelines. But recently after updating my Windows from 7 to 10, I lost all my saved password. I know, I should have backed up.\n\nNow I cannot login to Jenkins and they also do not have an option to Reset the password. So, the Only thing pending for me to update the Config File. I will show you the Step by Step process how I have recovered the password or better way to say How I managed to Login again to Jenkins Server.\n\nStep 1 : You need to get an Admin Privilege for the Windows Server where you have hosted your Jenkins and login to the Server and go inside the Jenkins folder.\n \nStep 2 : Then you need to Stop the Jenkins Service Using Command `jenkins.exe stop`\n\nStep 3 : Open config.xml file and update useSecurity as `false`.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514980455/wh3zf8tcfqoyf7i8jbtr.png)\n\nStep 4 : Start Jenkins Service Using Command `jenkins.exe start`.\n\nStep 5 : Now from the website again create a new User having the Admin privilege.\n\nThese are the above steps to recover the account if you have lost the admin password, but I do recommend not to lose the password and take a back up of it.\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a
