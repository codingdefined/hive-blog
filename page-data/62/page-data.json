I first met them when they had a small outlet at one of the popular malls in town. Sisters Akiko Tokunaga and Yuko Tokunaga with their close friend and partner Haruka Ninomiya came to India in 2015.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MOmNqdq.jpg\n<center><sup></sup></center>\n\nThey initially landed at Chennai based on the recommendation of a friend, but eventually visited Mangalore. They loved my city and decided to set up something here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cFwbPTZ.jpg\n\nAfter a year of running a small unit  at the local mall, a year ago they decided to open up a proper Cafe and I've been a regular customer ever since. Overtime they became my friends and I try and support their cafe whenever I can. We're all BIG fans of Japanese anime especially Dragon Ball Z, and I also happen to like the Japanese culture very much. In fact my friends have started calling me the brand ambassador of Cafe Tokimeki! \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iPX9nah.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/y7ZAKn4.jpg\n\nRecently, I was planning on a follow-up to the #1 India Steemit Accelerator and felt this was the best place for a meetup. It's small, cozy and comfy and everyone loves a good laugh here as we tend be very jovial patrons when we get together. I also felt this is a great opportunity to share some details about this wonderful cafe with our community here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YSZAXJF.jpg\n<center><sup>The whole spread!</sup></center>\n\n> Tokimeki as per my understanding means excitement in Japanese. \n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and I've got a few photos and captions to help you understand what they were. @srinidhi managed to have a spoonful of Wasabi which blew his mind! There are some funny pictures at the end. The food got over in no time, and we pretty much emptied the stock of Maki rolls in the restaurant.\n\n**Tokimeki is the best place to go for Japanese food in Mangalore and the next closest place is over 380 kms away in Bangalore city.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YX6xJ7W.jpg\n\n**As you can tell in the following pictures we loved the items on the menu and we ate a LOT!** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/drp5dEg.jpg\n<center><sup>Anko Toast - A little sweet and very delish item.

But many were travelling at the time so only a few showed up. It was good to regroup and discuss our individual progress on the platform and I'm happy to inform that my accelerator event helped these users understand the platform better.\n\nI also got a few ideas for the upcoming Bangalore event. It's good to see the Steemit community make a difference to the lives of many people across the world. \n\n### Because Meme Is Love, Meme Is Life! \n\nAs a group of friends we are quite funny and we all love memes so @speedracer dished out a few from the event and I hope you like them! \n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/oGOjVZ4.jpg</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HxlvdsN.jpg\n<center><sup>Join Steemit if not the Wolverine will strike!</sup></center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/h797Aj5.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/zm95L64.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/9g3Mhtl.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/cBT6f6u.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/NsqPZNK.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/JrX8g9w.jpg</center>\n<center><sup>Social Media Generation be Like!</sup></center>\n\n\n\n**If you live in Mangalore or are travelling through this city then this cafe is a must visit!** \n\nUntil next time, Sayonara folks! \n\n----------\n \n\n**If you like my work kindly resteem it to your friends.

Low or No payout is not the reason to think that your effort to this community is just a waste of time.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSTZfkoqWfEdyX2uT6mR3AZz2fbetbvsNoGQPYLTZ4jej/image.png)\n> [image source](http://dustinmaherfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-Dont-give-up.jpg)\n\n# On this article, I wanna summarised to you the 7 reasons why you should stop to think about giving up on Steemit... As briefly as possible... \n\n## 1. Steemit wasn't a burden, it's an enjoyable thing to do with your free time and if we earned - just a bonus.\n\nIf it wasn't to Steemit I could not imagine myself writing to add values to other. I wasn't even a writer or have any experience on blogging before Steemit. Given that English is not my first language, however, I could not resist the joy and excitement whenever I see and read other peoples blog. My little innocent mind is poured in every knowledge that I have read all the time that I spent in this wonderful community. Earning is just a little bonus from the community.\n\nhttp://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg\n> [image source](http://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg)\n\n## 2. Too many things to discover.\n\nIt's an awesome thing that I learned so much right from the very start when I created an account, it was like an endless learning. The more I read the more I am aware that I don't know anything. Every blog has all something in common denominator which is to add values to their readers not only that but also if you read also the comment like I always do. You will notice you gained more values that the community will benefit from it, every experience that shared of every steemians.\n\nEvery time other steemian posts about travel it feels like you're travelling too. Whenever they share the experience what it feels like to be in the classy restaurant and food looks really good it feels the same way right in very front of your computer. Good reasons that low payout doesn't stop you.\n\nhttp://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg\n> [image source](http://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg)\n\n## 3. Gaining more experience.\n\nI remembered a good verse in the bible that written in 1 Corinthians 10:11 ***\"Now all these things happened unto them for examples:\"***. Reading other person experience is a way better to learn. Like a great blog shared @lukestokes about his article [how he loss money on trading](https://steemit.com/hero/@lukestokes/i-got-margin-called-on-hero-today-things-don-t-always-go-up) being a good example to us. Other people experiences gives so much advantages even if we hardly see a dollar in our pending payouts sections.\n\nhttps://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png\n> [image source](https://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png)\n\n## 4. Blogging brings you awesome memories.\n\nHave you read the white paper on Steem? Are you aware that all we have created here on Steemit would remain in the blockchain and will not be deleted as long as internet and blockchain exist? This is the few reasons that low/no payout doesn't discourage you from creating valuable content. It creates wacky and memorable memory of you and me right on the blockchain. I feel way better on it than day trading on exchanges because it doesn't leave any mark to you and to the community, meanwhile, blogging is making yourself more valueble to others by putting your effort creating a good content.\n\n Imagine our great grandchild have a chance to see your article in the future because of the awesome technology we are using on Steem. They would feel very proud of you for the values and effort you have given out. Even if you didn't talk to them personally, however, on this article as if you are speaking to them, telling not to give up as well from what they persue in their life. Just what like you are showing them right now.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg\n> [image source](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg)\n\n## 5. You become more adaptable to the new technology.\n\nThis thing is revolutionary but I admit it to myself even I studied computer programming still have a hard time to grasp all things we need to learn inside. But before we knew it, we become more internet player because of continues blogging and engaging with this society. We used the Markdown and HTML codes often to enhance our writing, little we know we improve a lot compared to the time we created our very first blog. Learning gives us so much that it will serve us for many years to come in which I value more than $$$.\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg\n> [image source](https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg)\n\n## 6. You grow and thinking a lot in a tremendous way.\n\nThe mind is the greatest asset we had, not the stocks, nor the house, or Bitcoin. Our mind is our greatest asset of all. This tiny thing between our ears is what we need to nourish every time to create more asset. When we create a blog this little tiny thing is put to work. Like a muscle in our body, it grows bigger and bigger every time we used it. This thing can do so much, more than what we could have imagined. By blogging, we tremendously increased our mental capacity by thinking ***what is a great blog that the community will benefit more?*** By reading the blog and trying to add a valuable comment, this brain is put to work every time. \n\nhttps://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6\n> [image source](https://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6)\n\n## 7. On Steemit, the best is yet to come...\n\nAs long as we are in this awesome community, this place has so much space to grow. Did you listen to @jerrybanfield? [Steemit will possibly reach $10 per token in just 10 months or even more according to him](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jerrybanfield/10-reasons-for-usd10-steem-price-in-10-months).

Adhering to the traffic signal itself is a task that proves too difficult for most people. And in a country where flouting traffic rules is so widespread, accidents and mishaps are commonplace. Instead of blaming the government and whining about it, it’s about time that we started paying heed to Road Safety so that we can make our roads safer and more enjoyable to drive/ride on.\n\nYou might have noticed that some road markings are either white or yellow and sometimes they are continuous or broken. Each of these road markings in India are actually different signs that grant varying permissions to drivers on the road. Here’s what each one of them means.\n\nBroken White Line\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQmJh2VCkEP1g672QpbE7nwVAvy2M5HXTvFHwKByEi5bu/image.png)\n\nThe most common of road markings in India, a broken white line indicates that you may change lanes, overtake vehicles or make a U-turn after seeing that it is safe to do so.\n\nSolid White Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRajTTg9xTw41iXCuGuCV3kGvcV7r6byzpVs3CsoSmozR/image.png)\n\nYou cannot overtake a vehicle or make a U-turn if your on a road with a continuous white line. However, you may cross the line to avoid an obstruction or to exit the road to enter a perpendicular road.\n\nDouble Yellow Lines - Road Markings in India :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ6h5Ejxw4ccuZptwdJZUS8NpgS4fkbyZRvVXNScqnvaq/image.png)\n\nDouble Yellow lines can never be crossed unless it is to avoid a major obstruction. Usually used on 2-lane roads, it’s used to prevent crossing over into the lane with traffic going in the opposite direction.\n\nSingle Yellow Line next to a Broken Yellow Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY3DLd1dom4PZ2mVaYriTbbbU6CXBEm4fZv1dwxpSfJeC/image.png)\n\nThis type of road marking combines the rules of the first two markings in this list. If you are driving on the side with the broken line, you are allowed to overtake and if you’re driving on the side of the solid line, you’re not.\n\nNow, you are more theoretically qualified to be driving or riding on Indian roads than majority of the public. The next time you’re out on the road, see if you can follow these rules or spot anyone doing so.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"road\",\"life\",\"nature\",\"meaning\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmS597CPRRmS3c9mPo6fnbogwkiavUtj74En43c3zdK2z6\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQmJh2VCkEP1g672QpbE7nwVAvy2M5HXTvFHwKByEi5bu\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRajTTg9xTw41iXCuGuCV3kGvcV7r6byzpVs3CsoSmozR\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQ6h5Ejxw4ccuZptwdJZUS8NpgS4fkbyZRvVXNScqnvaq\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmY3DLd1dom4PZ2mVaYriTbbbU6CXBEm4fZv1dwxpSfJeC\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"8fa2b6cf-dd10-50ef-9a20-09c4de69e427","title":"My photography - Mushrooms (Original) 捡磨菇","author":"birds90","created":"July 14, 2017","permlink":"7qh3q-my-photography-mushrooms-original","body":"I have shoot a lot of mushrooms photos, want to shoot these mushrooms, the best time, after 24 hours of heavy rain,They are usually grown in Bamboo forest,damp,the cool place，There are many varieties of mushrooms, wild mushroom many are toxic and bacteria,So need to dry processing, and then eat,Together to enjoy\n以前我也拍过许多的磨菇，想要拍摄这些磨菇，最好的时间，是大雨过后的24小时内，它们一般生长在竹林，潮湿，阴凉的地方或者枯树上，磨菇有许多品种，野生的磨菇许多都有毒性和细菌，所以一般都是晒干加工，再食用，可食用的磨菇都很鲜美，一起来欣赏<br>\n\nThis is bamboo mushroom I found in the bamboo forest, is edible, nutrient-rich, the price is also very expensive\n这是竹林里发现的竹荪蘑菇，竹荪是可以食用，营养丰富，售价也很贵 <br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-279.jpg<br>\nThis mushroom looks good, but I do not know, do not pick it\n这种蘑菇长得很好看，但我不认识，不去摘它<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-192.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-190.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-191.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-280.jpg<br>\n\n\n\nIn our local people called the chicken for grams of mushroom, can eat, after the rain, people will go up the mountain to pick this mushroom\n这个在我们这里当地叫人称为鸡枞克的磨菇，可以食用，大雨过后，人们都会上山去捡<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-080.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-079.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-078.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-073-1.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-077.jpg<br>\n\n无论它们长得有多大，还是多好看, 不要轻易食用不认识的菌类<br>\nHope you like!","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"cn\",\"nature\",\"life\",\"food\"],\"image\":[\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-279.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-192.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-190.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-191.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-280.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-080.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-079.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-078.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-073-1.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-077.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d81e6cf5-0f9f-5d68-a807-45e124eb88f2","title":"Travel with me #78 : A visit to the magnificent Rose Island, Sandy Toes and snorkeling with Lion Fish!","author":"sweetsssj","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"travel-with-me-78-a-visit-to-the-magnificent-rose-island-sandy-toes-and-snorkeling-with-lion-fish","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\n\n![IMG_0548.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY8pnFGdtBcQXtoLhTD1i8XhLzqvyqcyy45vAz32wUJWG/IMG_0548.jpg)\n\nOne of the best things about Bahamas is how many beautiful exotic islands there are. In fact, there are over 700 islands and islets which constitute the country that is Bahamas. Each have their own unique pedigree but I'm sure most visitors to Bahamas will agree that they are all largely unspoiled and very picturesque!\n\nI haven't had much time to explore all the islands on this trip, but I did have the opportunity to visit the main ones like [Compass Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay), [Major Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs) and [Exuma Cays](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video).  Each had their own little surprises which are definitely worth a visit!\n\nWith so much to see and do, you might be wondering whether I had the opportunity to just enjoy the tropical weather, chill on the beach, swim in the sea and relax? The answer to that is yes! \n\nI had the pleasure of visiting ***Rose Island, Sandy Toes*** and spend a day sipping cocktails by the beach, and swimming in the sea! Many would say that's the ideal activity for such a vacation and I must say - I agree!\nhttps://image.ibb.co/dS0dqF/IMG_8023.jpg\n\n\n![DSC02068.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ81pNb12ovYRUMaYeZrdQfYaW5dwpdMqohPSyAUkHKnr/DSC02068.JPG)\n\nThe day started very early, I woke up around 7am to another gorgeous day brimming with sunshine and was ready for a lazy relaxing day at the private island known for it's pink sands!\n\nThe excursion was very easy to book, you can either book at your hotel, over the internet, or just turn up at the port where the boat leaves. Of course, I like to make sure everything is booked up in advance so I booked my excursion the very first day I arrived.  \n\nhttps://image.ibb.co/cZWUxv/IMG_8022.jpg\n\n![DSC02046.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSQda931aEthBzm7gEVtZSV9kNhCUCLy54SaC8wdMWzXm/DSC02046.JPG)\n\nThe gathering point for the boat trip is Magaritaville, a very popular restaurant and bar at the edge of Paradise Island. \n\n![DSC02043.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZSXw31d8ZKvC69xuXnnwPmHtisRNqz7eKkCfJfAZJP3g/DSC02043.JPG)\n\nJust beside Magaritaville, is the port where all of the boats are docked ready to take people all around Bahamas.\n\nThe bridge in the picture connects Nassau to Paradise Island and is quite impressive! \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kUEvKa/IMG_0497.jpg\n\nFor this trip, a speedboat wasn't necessary because there were probably around 50 other people coming as well.\nThe boat gently pulls out from the dock and makes it's way at moderate speed through the harbour towards the open seas. \n\n![DSC02050.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ7QqB5mHUfizmGg5UNpgsMuZGXCwmMhseZjAF1ytM9Wm/DSC02050.JPG)\n\nOnly 15 minutes later, we're already arriving at Rose Island. The boat trip was short and actually very pleasant. Before docking, we drove along the long elongated island and saw very few man made buildings there. It certainly looks like a paradise waiting for me to explore!\n\n![DSC02085.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf8eWHbHSJS1HjPn6ahy8rRy9EH76PWRdTxBDtbNbMYHB/DSC02085.JPG)\n\nThe boat pulls over at what looks like the only dock on the island and we all disembark the boat immediately clamouring up the side of the hill ready to explore.\n\n![DSC02096.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPYQBMwSuZT7g5GjcmyYifm3ynEZ6HREnhx2wzS5K8H4U/DSC02096.JPG)\n\n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k7rLkF/IMG_0498.jpg\n\n![DSC02097.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaLXTQnd2w5fKPTgx5hb56VM3ABxqRf3BHazrv5WLAYh7/DSC02097.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nfJpea/IMG_0499.jpg\n\nTo my surprise, I was greeted by a bunch of free roaming chickens! \n\n![DSC02102.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQme9z7cWH4FzoSR7BAiKSAc76ADUFSCYwHbPffZ2wt8hjf/DSC02102.JPG)\n\nA small narrow passage connects between the landing area and the beach. It's all very natural and walking through, I felt like I was trekking through a small forest with Chickens watching my every step. How peculiar! \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hpdpea/IMG_0500.jpg\n\nAmazingly, there were also quite a number of peacocks just chilling in the shade.  Coming so close to them, I'm amazed by their beautiful plumage. They are even more beautiful in person than the pictures could show.\n\n![DSC02113.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ3nwq8nqGb9hR41pXxaLdMAYR5cBFP9BSqLcDAPQpLQD/DSC02113.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dM46QF/IMG_0501.jpg\n\n![DSC02116.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVo2Z2yEfyybybqHShzVWHCGsefibq2WjdbtWDurhVojP/DSC02116.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nr6xXv/IMG_0502.jpg\n\n![DSC02117.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWvCsnsn9YASwZ3rfrtbnYjdrjzoG1kvJ9coEERvkt6Ap/DSC02117.JPG)\n\n![DSC02120.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSRpKAKkCXXvsrHGKE7M3V8iB5ADJ72uCvomXBXkkzPPt/DSC02120.JPG)\n\nAt the end of the little passage, we arrive at the beach bar and massage area which overlooks the sea and beautiful beach. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mUiNza/IMG_0503.jpg\n\nAs you can imagine, i'm a little anxious to get my my feet wet!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hOarsv/IMG_0504.jpg\n\nI was really blown away by the beautiful and natural setting. All around, there are these beautiful rock formations that have been left untouched preserving their beauty.\n\nIn the distance, you can see a neighbouring island like a mirage unveiled before your eyes.\n\n![DSC02269.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdwnN8emJyehBWovc8QoFBAvvQm4MdLzaAE8Q38e8A8Ez/DSC02269.JPG)\n\nOne of the best aspects about Rose Island is that it is a private island. This means there are virtually no people there and you can have so much of the beach to yourself. Exclusivity aside, the name ***Rose Island*** also comes from the fact that here, you will find the sandy beaches tinted in a slightly Rose colour. Sometimes, it's even called ***\"Pink Sands\"***.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eJjh0F/IMG_8708.jpg\n\nThe skies were absolutely amazing, whilst the sun toasted my skin and added to my already darkening skin tone, I kicked back for a moment to enjoy the neon-blue skies, threaded by heavenly white puffy clouds. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eD6vLF/IMG_8695.jpg\n\nWith such scenic and idyllic surroundings, it's hard to resist jumping for joy... \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gyTY5F/IMG_0506.jpg\n\nBefore long, I felt the need to take a dip in the calm and tranquil water. Like most other islands in Bahamas, the water clarity is something to me marvelled at. \n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k9nXza/IMG_0529.jpg\n\nJust around this rock formation, you can see the coral reefs through the crystal clear water. It's amazing how the water blends from a yellow colour and through a gradient all the way to the tiffany blue colour you see further out. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kYV0nv/IMG_8707.jpg\n\nPerfect opportunity for some on the fly photoshoots!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eDraKa/IMG_0510.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hoBUfF/IMG_8702.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/frjjCv/IMG_0523.jpg\n\nI really can't hold down my excitement so more jumping is due!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iLq2za/IMG_0516.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/i3YBsv/IMG_0515.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/d152za/IMG_0513.jpg\n\nAfter some time at the beach, the hosts kindly invited us over for some impromptu island lunch. \n\nMost people were happy to sit in the shade, but look at that view from the balcony! \n\n![IMG_8727.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYoJ5iHSWybWiipGXaemtcrUyJ8c5haiUko7HDRqv8hBe/IMG_8727.jpg)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cFWqnv/IMG_8739.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/j1bO7v/IMG_8738.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cNbZEa/IMG_8737.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hRPbSv/IMG_8736.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fHSVnv/IMG_8735.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mFPMua/IMG_8734.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bOpnZa/IMG_8733.jpg\n\nAfter lunch, we had a couple more hours to enjoy the beach, but for more the more adventurous of us, we had the option of doing some light snorkelling around the island. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jQMaKa/IMG_0512.jpg\n\nThe ideal snorkelling spot is just around that rock where the corals and reefs are.\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3XQpQko.gif\n</center>\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bRBaKa/IMG_0511.jpg\n\nIf you don't have your own gear, then they are happy to provide you with it for a small deposit.\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JhCeyRA.gif\n</center>\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/krV2za/IMG_0508.jpg\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vyhmKh7.gif\n</center>\n\n### Be sure to check out my video of my snorkelling adventure! Look out for the Lion Fish!\nhttps://youtu.be/PAXAiXZCqcc\n\nI made sure to leave a mark on the island before I left!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fvZChv/AEBA2_AFA_B49_B_4_FA2_A7_DF_8_B6_D7_B872909.jpg\n\nAnd that wraps up my day at Rose Island, Sandy Toes! After travelling around all over Bahamas, this one day mini escape to a private island was a much needed time to relax.  I can't stress how beautiful the island is with it's roaming chickens, peacocks and myriad of natural fish swimming around the surrounding corals. If or when you visit Bahamas, I highly recommend taking one day to enjoy this little gem of an island for a truly memorable day of pure relaxation!\n\nBe sure to upvote if you liked my post, follow

Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video)喂了漂亮的小蜥蜴，去了[Big Major Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs)和会游泳的小猪一起玩水，最后还去到了[Compass Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay)和水里的猛兽鲨鱼来了此彻彻底底的亲密接触。\n\n其实我知道巴哈马的招牌活动，除了和小猪一起游泳，另一个不得不去的就是粉色沙滩了。全世界唯一一片粉红色的沙滩，是因为海水冲刷红珊瑚而形成的，这里是度假天堂，也是拍照圣地。这片传说中的人间仙境位于巴哈马的Harbour Island东边，它有一个浪漫的不得了的名字——Rose Island玫瑰岛。这个保护这个地球上的粉色珍珠海滩，当地旅游公司实行了限制登岛流量的政策，每天只有50个人左右可以登上这个岛。所以我几乎提前一周，就预约了去岛上玩。今天我们就坐着小船，去探索一下最美丽的粉色沙滩吧，我已经兴奋的按捺不住了。今天我们要去玫瑰岛上的Sandy Toes沙滩的脚尖，这个名字是不是太有创意了。在船上，可以看到两岸一排排富人的别墅小洋房，白色，粉色的真漂亮，这25座色彩斑斓的小别墅融合了摩洛哥，印度和印尼巴厘岛等多种风格。船上放着欢快的音乐，游客们不自觉地跟着舞蹈起来，不一会就到了玫瑰岛。让我意料之外的是，岛上除了有最美颜色的沙滩，原来还有小鸡和孔雀，我赶紧过去和它们照相，孔雀的羽毛在阳光下闪闪发光。岛上的人们为了欢迎我们，还准备的欢迎的饮料，芒果味的鸡尾酒喝下去身体真清凉。顺着岛上各种形态的椰子树，就走到了海滩，海滩边还有一个酒吧，我们买了无限畅饮票的还可以一直喝饮料和酒水，真的太清凉了。这片粉色沙滩长约3英里，真正的粉色沙砾成了它的最大特点。再看看海水的颜色，在阳光下不停变换着它的颜色。到了中午用餐的时间，岛上的工作人员端来大盆的沙拉，热狗，还有烤鸡肉当作自助餐，坐在这样的美景前面，彻底陶醉了，都快要忘记吃饭了。\n\n这片岛除了是拍照圣地，还是浮浅的天堂。现在大家就跟随我的脚步，跳进海里，看看海底世界吧，希望大家喜欢我做的视频，别忘了看看我在水下拍摄的狮子鱼，这是我第一次有机会这么近距离看到这种鱼，它主要分布在东北部大西洋区，别看它长得美到像一朵盛开的菊花，它可是是吃肉的，以甲壳类为主要食物，如果不是它看到我过来，赶快沉到海底，我好像伸手过去摸摸它。希望大家很享受今天带大家体验的粉色沙滩之旅，之后还有更多有趣的美景和故事要分享给大家。","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"travel\",\"life\",\"photography\",\"blog\",\"cn\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmY8pnFGdtBcQXtoLhTD1i8XhLzqvyqcyy45vAz32wUJWG\\/IMG_0548.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/dS0dqF\\/IMG_8023.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQ81pNb12ovYRUMaYeZrdQfYaW5dwpdMqohPSyAUkHKnr\\/DSC02068.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cZWUxv\\/IMG_8022.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSQda931aEthBzm7gEVtZSV9kNhCUCLy54SaC8wdMWzXm\\/DSC02046.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZSXw31d8ZKvC69xuXnnwPmHtisRNqz7eKkCfJfAZJP3g\\/DSC02043.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/kUEvKa\\/IMG_0497.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ7QqB5mHUfizmGg5UNpgsMuZGXCwmMhseZjAF1ytM9Wm\\/DSC02050.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmf8eWHbHSJS1HjPn6ahy8rRy9EH76PWRdTxBDtbNbMYHB\\/DSC02085.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmPYQBMwSuZT7g5GjcmyYifm3ynEZ6HREnhx2wzS5K8H4U\\/DSC02096.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/k7rLkF\\/IMG_0498.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaLXTQnd2w5fKPTgx5hb56VM3ABxqRf3BHazrv5WLAYh7\\/DSC02097.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/nfJpea\\/IMG_0499.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQme9z7cWH4FzoSR7BAiKSAc76ADUFSCYwHbPffZ2wt8hjf\\/DSC02102.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hpdpea\\/IMG_0500.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ3nwq8nqGb9hR41pXxaLdMAYR5cBFP9BSqLcDAPQpLQD\\/DSC02113.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/dM46QF\\/IMG_0501.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmVo2Z2yEfyybybqHShzVWHCGsefibq2WjdbtWDurhVojP\\/DSC02116.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/nr6xXv\\/IMG_0502.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmWvCsnsn9YASwZ3rfrtbnYjdrjzoG1kvJ9coEERvkt6Ap\\/DSC02117.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSRpKAKkCXXvsrHGKE7M3V8iB5ADJ72uCvomXBXkkzPPt\\/DSC02120.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/mUiNza\\/IMG_0503.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hOarsv\\/IMG_0504.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmdwnN8emJyehBWovc8QoFBAvvQm4MdLzaAE8Q38e8A8Ez\\/DSC02269.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eJjh0F\\/IMG_8708.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eD6vLF\\/IMG_8695.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/gyTY5F\\/IMG_0506.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/k9nXza\\/IMG_0529.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/kYV0nv\\/IMG_8707.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eDraKa\\/IMG_0510.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hoBUfF\\/IMG_8702.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/frjjCv\\/IMG_0523.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/iLq2za\\/IMG_0516.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/i3YBsv\\/IMG_0515.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/d152za\\/IMG_0513.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYoJ5iHSWybWiipGXaemtcrUyJ8c5haiUko7HDRqv8hBe\\/IMG_8727.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cFWqnv\\/IMG_8739.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/j1bO7v\\/IMG_8738.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cNbZEa\\/IMG_8737.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hRPbSv\\/IMG_8736.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/fHSVnv\\/IMG_8735.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/mFPMua\\/IMG_8734.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/bOpnZa\\/IMG_8733.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/jQMaKa\\/IMG_0512.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/3XQpQko.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/bRBaKa\\/IMG_0511.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/JhCeyRA.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/krV2za\\/IMG_0508.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/vyhmKh7.gif\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/PAXAiXZCqcc\\/0.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/fvZChv\\/AEBA2_AFA_B49_B_4_FA2_A7_DF_8_B6_D7_B872909.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video\",\"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/PAXAiXZCqcc\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":610,"numPages":74,"currentPage":62}}}
