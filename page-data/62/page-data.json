I'm okay with people holding different opinions as long as they are open to discussing them. So, here are some people I don't always agree with, but I still choose to follow some of them:\n\n* @everittdmickey has strong view on bots and flagging on Steemit. He's very active here.\n* @shayne may be a bit of a Trump fan, but he's not so bad really ;) I don't buy into some of the things he posts about, but we get along.\n* @mindhunter has different opinions to me on various aspects of politics and finance, but he's a smart guy and one of the most active posters on Steemit.\n* I've known @jumowa for a few years. He thinks I'm a little na√Øve when it comes to trusting the news, but I think I'm less so than most people and I am open to different points of view.\n* @dickturpin is the only one of these I've actually met. We differ in our politics, but otherwise I think we have a lot in common.\n\nJust because you disagree with someone about some topics doesn't mean you can't be friends. We should not be afraid to admit we are wrong sometimes.\n\nOther people are using [the Follow Friday tag](https://steemit.com/trending/followfriday). We need ways to discover people to follow. Just following everyone you encounter will lead to a feed you can't keep up with. It pays to be choosy. I did the [first of these posts](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steevc/fridays-are-for-following-on-steemit) about ten months ago and I think I've done just about every week since then. Steemit is not showing all the posts when you click on the tag these days, but you can find a lot of them with the search.\n\nSteem on!\n\n<p><b><div class=\"pull-left\"><img src=\"https://steevc.keybase.pub/steemit/steevc.png\"></div>\nI'm Steve, the geeky guitarist. </b></p><p>I'll buy <a href=\"https://steemit.com/guitar/@steevc/steem-for-picks\">guitar picks for Steem Dollars</a></p>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"followfriday\",\"steemit\",\"discovery\",\"steemians\",\"following\"],\"users\":[\"everittdmickey\",\"shayne\",\"mindhunter\",\"jumowa\",\"dickturpin\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steevc.keybase.pub\\/steemit\\/steevc.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/trending\\/followfriday\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/steemit\\/@steevc\\/fridays-are-for-following-on-steemit\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/guitar\\/@steevc\\/steem-for-picks\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b2a908e6-e59a-5bab-91be-1240e48a921d","title":"Creating The World We Long For!","author":"teamsteem","created":"July 20, 2017","permlink":"creating-the-world-we-long-for","body":"https://i.imgur.com/Gl2osAt.jpg\n\n1600 - Steem's popularity is skyrocketing! Join now and profit! Seriously! And for everyone else already on Steem, let's boost this growing popularity even more. \n\nThis post is about how to create the world we long for and how Steem and other cryptocurrencies can play a big part in this, why we should all try to boost Steem's growth with each of our posts as well as ways to incentivize such sharing so it becomes part of Steemians' second nature.     \n\nMost people who could benefit from using Steem haven't heard about it yet and it's a no-brainer for everyone  to work toward a better world helping remediate to this.  \n\n## Steem Pays Its Users! ##\n\nSteem is a revolutionary social network which pays its users for the votes, posts and comments they make depending on the votes they received. Not all votes are equal. \n\nI've made a lot of money Steeming in the last year, more than a hundred thousand dollars, but there's possibly very few people who can still expect to make many thousands solely blogging nowadays. \n\nSteem is the name of the technology and data base on which Steemit runs. Steemit is only one of the the many projects using this data base. [Busy.org](https://busy.org/) is another example, displaying the same information but differently. \n\nSteem is also the name of the currency users are being paid with. Each Steem are currently worth around [1,40$](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets) and can easily be exchange for money. Steem is currently distributing around 63,000 Steem daily.\n\nNo credit card is required ever. The only thing needed to register is a valid email account. \n\nSteem details of its functionings can be found [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@teamsteem/steem-an-in-depth-overview). \n\nSign up [here](https://steemit.com/pick_account). \n\n## The Opportunity Of A Lifetime! \n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/20/27/sunrise-165094_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nWe're still very early and the opportunity to make interesting profits are very real. Steem currently has a bit more than 263,000 accounts.\n\nIt's somewhat getting increasingly harder to succeed but any success is also increasingly more rewarding as we go. \n\nAny posts or comments can pay their authors from mere pennies to hundreds of dollars and even though the trending page is filled with posts making hundreds of dollars, no new authors should expect their posts to make this much money even though it remains a possibility. \n\nMost trending posts are from established authors holding a lot of Steem and thus having a lot to lose or gain from the Steem price performance. Also, people holding a lot of Steem are leveraging them to receive more votes and thus bigger rewards. \n\nPosting anything will get their authors some rewards, from not quite a penny to much larger rewards as mention above. Posts can be a simple link or image or more extensive post. \n\nNew authors should probably stick to short posts requiring small amount of work and which are fun and witty, that is unless they know how to make their posts being paid well or if they are writing those posts with a precise objective which suits them. \n\n## Steem Popularity Is Skyrocketing! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2010/12/01/space-shuttle-774_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n  \nSteem is the most fun social network and its meteoric growth is a testament to that.\n\nSteem steemed from concept to reality in early 2016, to become the [3,673](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/steemit.com) most visiting website today and is still going up the rank at a frantic pace. \n\nCryptocurrencies are changing the way money is created, distributed and transacted and now Steem also change the way information is disseminated. Money \"rule\" the world and money creation rules money but that's a topic for another post. \n\nEvery 3 seconds new Steem are created and distributed by a network of computers which no single entity control. \n\nIf steemit.com were to close every Steemians would still have control of their funds and they could still access their exact same blog through other site like [busy.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiE6_DriJbVAhXDuhQKHcPRCzoQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusy.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNHRaFK-QAtRGOkZjASdIcd9PQ4FoA) or app like [eSteem](https://steemit.com/esteem/@good-karma/esteem-frequently-asked-questions-faq-eys44lmimx).\n\n## Hundreds Are Joining Everyday!\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/13/08/02/shaking-hands-2499612_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nHundreds of people are already joining Steem everyday, sometimes thousands and in a few months it could be tens of thousands. \n\nI know a lot of us wished we were making and publishing video when Youtube got launched back in early 2005. There wasn't a lot of competition back then and this would have been a good opportunity to build a valuable and fun business. \n\nThe same can be said about Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. People with a lot of followers on these websites are receiving advertising offers and some of them are getting well paid to post simple advertising links. \n\nSteem present even bigger opportunities than these websites and is still in its very early days. \n\nJoining emerging social networks very early can be very rewarding and Steem is no exception.  \n\n## Our Thoughts And Actions' Purpose ##\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/08/22/26/meditation-2214532_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nThe very purpose of our thoughts and actions should be to create the world we long for and for this to happen, it's necessary to have our ideas shared by a growing number of people, therein lies the need to share our Steem posts far and wide as much as possible. \n\nSteem and all its users will gain immensely from accelerating Steem's growth. Steem content will get much more diversify, plenty and authors will feed on each others influence of ever more enlightening reflections. \n\nThe real value in each of our lives lie in the joy our actions and knowledge bring us rather than in any sorts of pseudo valuable we own, like national currencies. \n\nCooperation amplify our joy while its opposite, abuse, leads to mutual destruction. Let's work toward greater cooperation and curtailing abuse whenever possible. \n\nOur posts should also have a place left open to introduce people to what Steem is and what it can do for them. \n\n## Creating Beneficial Change! \n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/22/17/58/clasped-hands-541849_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nAs I've laid out above, reaching out to people is one of the most important thing in regard to creating the world we long for that's why I want to reward those who are doing it. \n\nMy 100% upvote is worth around 70$ and I have 10 of these every 24 hours. I don't necessarily plan on giving only 100% upvote but I would love to give at least one a day for the best outreach posts. \n\nFive days ago I said I would do such a thing for introduction posts. See [here](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me).  It turned out I gave 6 100% votes in a roughly 24 hours period. Here's the [list](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me#@teamsteem/re-teamsteem-hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me-20170719t225913791z) of those posts. \n\nAny posts can be used to promote Steem, even introduction post. I will look for these posts promoting Steem in the tag #promoting-steem. \n\nNone of officially listed tags on Steemit are about promoting Steem. See [here](https://steemit.com/tags). \n\n## Creating The Culture We Long To Live From! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/02/01/15/orange-tree-1117420_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nLet's create a culture where it's in everyone's second nature to share their most useful knowledge and human power. \n\nSharing our posts as much as possible should be part of this. Promoting Steem can be easy and can make any already valuable posts even more valuable. \n\nIt's easier to create a good post promoting Steem than to make any other type of post.   \n\n## I Made Money On Steemit And So Can You!\n\nThere's so many people in dire need of money that money can always be used to attract attention but everyone should make sure to be honest though and clearly state that most people won't probably make as much money as the earliest adopters. \n\nNow no matter how much money people will make on average, Steem truly is a revolutionary technology and that's one of the reason why I want to share it far and wide as much as possible. I've already shared about all this throughout most of my posts. Here's one good [example](https://steemit.com/cooperation/@teamsteem/cooperation-is-humanity-s-greatest-asset). \n\nBy the way, a click-bait title is only a click-bait if the post isn't a useful post to the person who clicked on it. A title's purpose is to have people click on it and the intent of someone clicking on a link is to have a good time seeing what's behind that link. \n\n## Let's Reward Promoting Steem!\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/05/09/13/setting-2473874_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\n\n\nI will peruse the #promoting-steem tag. I invite others to join too. People should mention approximately how many people they will share their posts with, as well as provide links to these posts from their social media where they shared their posts. \n\nI use [Bitly.com](https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks) to share my links on other social networks. Bitly allow me to know how many people clicked on my links and also when. \n\nI have more than 200 clicks from Facebook's profile, on one of my [post](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan/posts/10159024444040471) I shared there last week. I also have more than [90 views](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/posts/1172186039593860) on the same post I share on one of my Facebook page. \n\nSteemit.com receive around [555k page views](http://www.hypestat.com/info/steemit.com) per day and around [14.4k Steem posts](https://steemdata.com/charts) are published every day. If everyone shared their posts and received only 10 clicks on them then that would result in a 25% increase in page views per day. From there, even more could be achieved.     \n\nIt's a given, Steem's already skyrocketing popularity would experience an epic boost if everyone would shared most of their Steem posts to their other social networks and that's why we should all make concerting efforts toward this goal.  \n\n# Boosting Steemit's Already Existing Buzz! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/19/15/audience-1850119_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nEach and every time people will hear about Steem should help generate create more interest.  \n\nTagging friends on Facebook and Twitter as well as adding tag there, will definitely helps your posts get more views.\n\nIf a lot of people begin to use the tag #promoting-steem then it might be a good idea to put the number of people the post is going to be shared with in the first line under the title's post like I did. \n\nThe number of people being reached out isn't the only thing I'll be looking in rewarding posts. I'll also be looking at the overall quality. \n\nI encourage everyone to help me incentivize this habit of doing as much as possible to boost Steem's growth. \n\nWhether or not this initiative will do much difference remains to be seen. It might or might not but I felt like trying.\n\n## Shared On ##\n\n- Facebook Profile: ([760](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan))\n- Facebook Page: ([204 followers](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/))\n- Twitter: ([600](https://twitter.com/TeamSteemLive)) \n- Instragram: (I'll be using it in the future)\n \n## I'd Love To Change The World!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1URj5VJl_JE\n\nThank you to @papa-pepper for the awesome t-shirt! \n\n## Thank You!\n\nThank you for reading and for commenting!

I first met them when they had a small outlet at one of the popular malls in town. Sisters Akiko Tokunaga and Yuko Tokunaga with their close friend and partner Haruka Ninomiya came to India in 2015.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MOmNqdq.jpg\n<center><sup></sup></center>\n\nThey initially landed at Chennai based on the recommendation of a friend, but eventually visited Mangalore. They loved my city and decided to set up something here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cFwbPTZ.jpg\n\nAfter a year of running a small unit  at the local mall, a year ago they decided to open up a proper Cafe and I've been a regular customer ever since. Overtime they became my friends and I try and support their cafe whenever I can. We're all BIG fans of Japanese anime especially Dragon Ball Z, and I also happen to like the Japanese culture very much. In fact my friends have started calling me the brand ambassador of Cafe Tokimeki! \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iPX9nah.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/y7ZAKn4.jpg\n\nRecently, I was planning on a follow-up to the #1 India Steemit Accelerator and felt this was the best place for a meetup. It's small, cozy and comfy and everyone loves a good laugh here as we tend be very jovial patrons when we get together. I also felt this is a great opportunity to share some details about this wonderful cafe with our community here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YSZAXJF.jpg\n<center><sup>The whole spread!</sup></center>\n\n> Tokimeki as per my understanding means excitement in Japanese. \n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and I've got a few photos and captions to help you understand what they were. @srinidhi managed to have a spoonful of Wasabi which blew his mind! There are some funny pictures at the end. The food got over in no time, and we pretty much emptied the stock of Maki rolls in the restaurant.\n\n**Tokimeki is the best place to go for Japanese food in Mangalore and the next closest place is over 380 kms away in Bangalore city.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YX6xJ7W.jpg\n\n**As you can tell in the following pictures we loved the items on the menu and we ate a LOT!** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/drp5dEg.jpg\n<center><sup>Anko Toast - A little sweet and very delish item.

It was good to regroup and discuss our individual progress on the platform and I'm happy to inform that my accelerator event helped these users understand the platform better.\n\nI also got a few ideas for the upcoming Bangalore event. It's good to see the Steemit community make a difference to the lives of many people across the world. \n\n### Because Meme Is Love, Meme Is Life! \n\nAs a group of friends we are quite funny and we all love memes so @speedracer dished out a few from the event and I hope you like them! \n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/oGOjVZ4.jpg</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HxlvdsN.jpg\n<center><sup>Join Steemit if not the Wolverine will strike!</sup></center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/h797Aj5.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/zm95L64.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/9g3Mhtl.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/cBT6f6u.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/NsqPZNK.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/JrX8g9w.jpg</center>\n<center><sup>Social Media Generation be Like!</sup></center>\n\n\n\n**If you live in Mangalore or are travelling through this city then this cafe is a must visit!** \n\nUntil next time, Sayonara folks! \n\n----------\n \n\n**If you like my work kindly resteem it to your friends.

Low or No payout is not the reason to think that your effort to this community is just a waste of time.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSTZfkoqWfEdyX2uT6mR3AZz2fbetbvsNoGQPYLTZ4jej/image.png)\n> [image source](http://dustinmaherfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-Dont-give-up.jpg)\n\n# On this article, I wanna summarised to you the 7 reasons why you should stop to think about giving up on Steemit... As briefly as possible... \n\n## 1. Steemit wasn't a burden, it's an enjoyable thing to do with your free time and if we earned - just a bonus.\n\nIf it wasn't to Steemit I could not imagine myself writing to add values to other. I wasn't even a writer or have any experience on blogging before Steemit. Given that English is not my first language, however, I could not resist the joy and excitement whenever I see and read other peoples blog. My little innocent mind is poured in every knowledge that I have read all the time that I spent in this wonderful community. Earning is just a little bonus from the community.\n\nhttp://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg\n> [image source](http://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg)\n\n## 2. Too many things to discover.\n\nIt's an awesome thing that I learned so much right from the very start when I created an account, it was like an endless learning. The more I read the more I am aware that I don't know anything. Every blog has all something in common denominator which is to add values to their readers not only that but also if you read also the comment like I always do. You will notice you gained more values that the community will benefit from it, every experience that shared of every steemians.\n\nEvery time other steemian posts about travel it feels like you're travelling too. Whenever they share the experience what it feels like to be in the classy restaurant and food looks really good it feels the same way right in very front of your computer. Good reasons that low payout doesn't stop you.\n\nhttp://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg\n> [image source](http://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg)\n\n## 3. Gaining more experience.\n\nI remembered a good verse in the bible that written in 1 Corinthians 10:11 ***\"Now all these things happened unto them for examples:\"***. Reading other person experience is a way better to learn. Like a great blog shared @lukestokes about his article [how he loss money on trading](https://steemit.com/hero/@lukestokes/i-got-margin-called-on-hero-today-things-don-t-always-go-up) being a good example to us. Other people experiences gives so much advantages even if we hardly see a dollar in our pending payouts sections.\n\nhttps://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png\n> [image source](https://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png)\n\n## 4. Blogging brings you awesome memories.\n\nHave you read the white paper on Steem? Are you aware that all we have created here on Steemit would remain in the blockchain and will not be deleted as long as internet and blockchain exist? This is the few reasons that low/no payout doesn't discourage you from creating valuable content. It creates wacky and memorable memory of you and me right on the blockchain. I feel way better on it than day trading on exchanges because it doesn't leave any mark to you and to the community, meanwhile, blogging is making yourself more valueble to others by putting your effort creating a good content.\n\n Imagine our great grandchild have a chance to see your article in the future because of the awesome technology we are using on Steem. They would feel very proud of you for the values and effort you have given out. Even if you didn't talk to them personally, however, on this article as if you are speaking to them, telling not to give up as well from what they persue in their life. Just what like you are showing them right now.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg\n> [image source](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg)\n\n## 5. You become more adaptable to the new technology.\n\nThis thing is revolutionary but I admit it to myself even I studied computer programming still have a hard time to grasp all things we need to learn inside. But before we knew it, we become more internet player because of continues blogging and engaging with this society. We used the Markdown and HTML codes often to enhance our writing, little we know we improve a lot compared to the time we created our very first blog. Learning gives us so much that it will serve us for many years to come in which I value more than $$$.\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg\n> [image source](https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg)\n\n## 6. You grow and thinking a lot in a tremendous way.\n\nThe mind is the greatest asset we had, not the stocks, nor the house, or Bitcoin. Our mind is our greatest asset of all. This tiny thing between our ears is what we need to nourish every time to create more asset. When we create a blog this little tiny thing is put to work. Like a muscle in our body, it grows bigger and bigger every time we used it. This thing can do so much, more than what we could have imagined. By blogging, we tremendously increased our mental capacity by thinking ***what is a great blog that the community will benefit more?*** By reading the blog and trying to add a valuable comment, this brain is put to work every time. \n\nhttps://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6\n> [image source](https://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6)\n\n## 7.

Crypto's will be going up soon.  I've noticed that Crypto currencies like to ride up and down big waves.  Just look at how a roller coaster gains speed to move back up the high tracks.  First the Coaster must go down at a steep incline, and then it races back up quickly.  No worries folks.  Crypto's are now about to race up.
