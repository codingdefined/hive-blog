In the last 2 days, I got 3 downvotes, no big deal though. The account which has downvoted me are :\n\n@crapal, @hipla, and @qitrulle\n\nLooking at their profile and wallet every one has 25 Reputation and having 15.010 SP. But one thing is interesting with all the account is that they all have received 0.001 STEEM from @arcange fro supporting his witness, as the memo stated \"Thank you so much for your support to my witness! ðŸ™‡\" and also sent that 0.001 STEEM to @camillesteemer, all three of them and on the same day same time. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeqASm86yxSZFsYcF2nixsYsCLkD3KAwMg2zqCA1VASbL)\n\n\nLooking at the account, not only three but like 100s of account has transferred 0.001 STEEM to @camillesteemer. It looks like he is handling the downvoters gang and downvotes with these accounts to all the Steem Users.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmcE65Vmt7JsCLvGNKcudCkJ1N2sFhNafNMpHWMbVcLLzf)\n\nWhat he gains from it, no one knows. Why is he doing it, I guess no one knows too.\n","created":"November 07, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Is there a Downvoters Gang or is it a Single Person","permlink":"is-there-a-downvoters-gang-or-is-it-a-single-person","previous":{"title":"A tiring festive season","permlink":"a-tiring-festive-season"},"next":{"title":"When you can't see what's below you","permlink":"when-you-can-t-see-what-s-below-you"}}}}
