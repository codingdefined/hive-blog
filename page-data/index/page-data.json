First of all for watching a sunrise I need to wake up early in the morning which I am not very fond of. Secondly, there are more dust, smog, and clouds at sunset and thus those elements diffuse the light, which makes it bigger and dramatic scenes. Whereas in the case of Sunrise,  the sky is clean and clear most of the time, thus you see Sun and its light everywhere.\n\nOne more thing everyone likes Sunset is that you can raise a glass to Sunset. Tea, Cofee, Alchohol, who drinks that at the time of sunrise, but most of the folks drinks it at the time of Sunset watching the scenes and enjoying the moment.\n\nFew Sunset Photos Clicked by me:\n\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQF9MbrrdiL9MmYPg7AoTFt4euGmfbGmNdEqcpVsY19Vr/IMG_20171110_180303.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQEwmp4SFzZsfecjSSs49Zg3THPTu7Dq5THr7pjgUoAG6/IMG_20180216_181424_2.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQCFZ5ahBfFwEDRv4pR81EMfDF94wMY4poUAqG6vKnTKZ/IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"askhive\",\"india\",\"nature\",\"blog\",\"beautiful\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQF9MbrrdiL9MmYPg7AoTFt4euGmfbGmNdEqcpVsY19Vr\\/IMG_20171110_180303.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQEwmp4SFzZsfecjSSs49Zg3THPTu7Dq5THr7pjgUoAG6\\/IMG_20180216_181424_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQCFZ5ahBfFwEDRv4pR81EMfDF94wMY4poUAqG6vKnTKZ\\/IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"62ff283d-44f8-5364-bf3e-b9292df2910c","title":"Innovative Way to Ask People to Stay at Home","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 09, 2020","permlink":"innovative-way-to-ask-people-to-stay-at-home","body":"With the lockdown relaxation from 4th May had started where there was some relaxation for the Green and Orange Zones whereas in Red Zones the relaxation is much less.\n\nTo Understand the post, let me explain Red Zone, Orange Zone and Green Zone. Red Zone is the district where there was an Active case found in last 7 days, Orange Zone is the one where no new case in last 7 days but the active corona cases where present. Green Zone is the one where no new cases found in last 14 days as well as there is no active cases. \n\nSo from 4th May, Government of India divided whole India in these three zones and thus equivalent restrictions where imposed so that people will stay at Hone. The problem is Bangalore is in Red Zone, but still people are coming out of the home just like previous days. Some where chilling out, some are making weekends plan, so and so. \n\nThe Police Department in Bangalore has put up a banner telling about Weekend Planners to take a quiz before heading out.\n\n![xbtbtj.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/xbtbtj.jpg)\nPC- Google.com\n\nNow whatever number you choose after doing the mathematical calculation, it will always come as 9, that means Stay At Home instead of going out.\n\nThis is innovative way to make people understand to stay at home. But my question remains the same, why people I'm Bangalore are coming out even though it is been marked as Red Zone, what is government doing. I know the small owners are the one who are the suffering the most but the government has to provide them some relief instead of opening up everything.\n\nThough, what I found out is that each one of the people on the road are wearing masks which is a good sign, I.e. a sense of responsibility. Hope this coronavirus pandemic ends soon.\n\nBe healthy, Be safe and Please stay at home and don't go out if there is no necessity.","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.app\\/xbtbtj.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"lockdown\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"health\",\"stayathome\",\"coronavirus\",\"dblog\",\"writing\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.5-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"hive-125125\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"7835c39c-1587-566a-bbc6-86a30802e29f","title":"Github lanched Github Codespaces","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 08, 2020","permlink":"github-lanched-github-codespaces","body":"GitHub Codespaces is a new online development environment launched and hosted by Github and its powered by Visual Studio Code.

Going Sugar-Free - I have to congratulate myself on going sugar-free from the last 1 month because I know sugar is that bad element that can hamper your health more than anything. Though I don't advise people to go full sugar-free but try to limit it because excess sugar is one of the primary reasons for weight gain.\n2. Drink a lot of water - When I was in office I had a tendency to go and fill a 500 ml of water every 2 hours, thus I was easily drinking around 5 liters every day. Now at home, I try to keep that habit and keep myself hydrated.\n3. Avoid Binge Eating - While at home, we do cook our food and thus eat a few fried food while cooking something special but I do try to avoid binge eating at any cost.\n\nHow you are keeping yourself fit during a lockdown?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"askthehive\",\"fit\",\"healthy\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmZmsn98N7kgDbjGxw4QuKaCpwcGhJErzaVwoPoevSkfQQ\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"447ab732-0e71-57d5-8063-c024ce4a8e12","title":"Be a long term Investor","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 06, 2020","permlink":"be-a-long-term-investor","body":"Now the recession is around the corner and everyone is asking what should people be doing with their investment, should they cash out and sit on the cash, should they keep invested as this time is short-lived or something else.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmYFm7j3no4VNpo7k7Yyns9YViydwKh4DmqD8v45aZYGSb/image.png)\nPC: Pexels.com\n\nIf we go by history we have seen a lot of ups and downs in the market, be it 2008 or 2013 or even in 2019. No one would have predicted this even the great Warren Buffet because you don't know the future. \n\nLet's go by the Quote of Warren Buffet which says \n\n>\"We have long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune-tellers look good.\" I'm amazed at how many investors take market forecasters seriously, even when they have no credible track records of success.\"\n\nThose who all are saying that they knew it, are just falsely trying to sell their narratives. You might be sitting on negative returns or the loss but right now the main goal is to email calm, buy the dip and hold it till the market goes back again. You might think of rebalancing your stocks, if you are too much into the bank or oil try to get Pharma or FMGC etc.\n\nYou might be excited about the market fall but don't wait to get into the market by having loads of cash.

Our company is situated in India, so most people have given the perspective with respect to the lockdown in India. The lockdown in India has started on 24 March 2020 for 21 days then extending it to 19 days and then again for 14 days. So we are still in Lockdown which might get over on 17th May. \n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmUnucgdyca1HGydd4XgUUbGZXtJqWUPENbqBXQ3oxTnWq/image.png)\nPC: Pexels.com\n\nI am saying might because if the cases do not come down, we might see an increase in lockdown days. Though in the 3rd lockdown which has started on 4th May, we have got a lot more relaxed than the previous two, like the liquor shop was closed for almost 40 days but it was opened yesterday for people.\n\nSo coming back to the point, a lot of employees have given the answers including me, I will just summarize those points in this post. \n\nAn employee has written that the lockdown taught him to keep himself engaged in Reading books which helped him upgrading his skills along with getting a lot of knowledge. The two books which he will recommend is \n \n1-Five Dysfunctions of the Team\n2-Total Money Makeover-Financial Planning.\n \nAnother employee has written that he is experiencing life skills, proactiveness, and Patience. He is also getting a deep insight into what our previous generation have enjoyed without all the buzz and hype like social media or smartphone. He also lists down some of the points which we all should follow in this lockdown\n\n1. Restrict Negativity & add positivity by learning new things.\n2. Ensure to connect with family members, friends & colleagues.\n3. Appreciate small things\n4. Respect Nature and Cherish the Silence\n5. Health is Wealth\n6. Curb indiscriminate Spending\n7. Have patience\n8. Indebted to people who put their lives at stake for others\n\nAnother employee has given a perspective about all the countries which are facing this pandemic by saying that we humans are very vulnerable where a microorganism has put everyone including the developed countries on their foot. A micro virus can jail us for weeks in our own home like prisoners. Great and powerful nations have bowed down and their ego has shattered instantly. These countries have invested millions or billions to protect their land and boundaries in arms and ammunition but never anticipated that the enemy can be a form of Lilliput which cannot be seen through the naked eyes which can bring the complete shutdown and cost millions or billions. Threat and death can come anytime are the realization so its high time to be humble and be grounded till we inhale our last breath. \n\nHe also lists down the positivity caused by the lockdown and they are\n\n1. Rivers which were polluted have purified themselves\n2. Air which was polluted have become cleaner\n3. The ozone layer is said to be healing itself.\n4. All religious places are at peace from humans.\n5. Humans are trapped and animals are free-roaming outside.\n6. Marriages that had become an event to show off prosperity have very few audiences now.\n7. All luxury has come to a dead-end and Real necessity has taken the extra mile.\n8. Work is happening from home without \"Power dressing\" where we all were mimicking west and had believed its the success mantra. \n9. A simple cough, sneeze, and fever will threaten us of CORONA every moment in the days to come.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmfZpK28j5ECW2SQbuzceYHkstnHHZn1Rhw62H7XEWTfsN/image.png)\nPC: Pexels.com\n\nThe points made by other employees are like : \n\n1. Lockdown taught me to understand the value of doctors, other healthcare officials, police, and emergency workers.\n2. Lockdown taught me I can survive 50 days without going to any Restaurant, Malls to have food ( It is achievable) and finally I found who takes a major chunk of my credit card bill.\n3. My family expense to lead a healthy life is less than 120$ remaining whatever I spent to date is luxury. \n4. Lockdown taught me to respect the value of savings. I come from a middle-class family now this lockdown makes me understand the importance of a single penny. \n5. Lockdown taught me to spend time with my parents and other family members which is almost an impossible task during normal life.\n6. How fragile our healthcare system is and how much we have to prepare in case of an attack from an invisible enemy.\n7. How underprepared our nation for a pandemic attack and how important is to prepare our system with healthcare infrastructure, medicine, and pharma equipment.\n8. How important it is to be healthy and fit not just physically but also mentally!\n9. It is possible to be at home and work efficiently with our global counterparts.\n10. Last but not the least, Lockdown gave us a glimpse of our life post-retirement!! \n11. . Reinvent your childhood dreams which you might have forgotten on your way to building a better career and a better lifestyle. Slow down and find yourself again \n12.  Learn to be calm amid chaos\n13. When you can’t control the situation, control your emotion, and learn to be patient and wait. Surely something positive will come out of it. Just wait and Watch\n14. There is nothing wrong in being considerate and sensitive about your fellow beings need and well being \n15. Put a Control over your greediness, let others also live in Peace, or in other words be aware that there are others also living in this world with whom we need to share the land, air, water, and other basic necessities\n\nWhat Lockdown taught you?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"ocd\",\"india\",\"lockdown\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"posh\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmUnucgdyca1HGydd4XgUUbGZXtJqWUPENbqBXQ3oxTnWq\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmfZpK28j5ECW2SQbuzceYHkstnHHZn1Rhw62H7XEWTfsN\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3db1924f-c228-56e2-b94b-0254cd003e42","title":"Is Artificial Intelligence better than Human Intelligence?","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 04, 2020","permlink":"is-artificial-intelligence-better-than-human-intelligence","body":"![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPgcD1bMFc6X6WBL1DAxJeCftMbamU2wqDhWrcXbxZhEX/image.png)\n\nPC: Pexels.com","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmPgcD1bMFc6X6WBL1DAxJeCftMbamU2wqDhWrcXbxZhEX\\/image.png\"],\"tags\":[\"askhive\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.5-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"hive-125125\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"ccf334ba-558d-561c-afb4-f687623b82f8","title":"Full Time or Freelancer?","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 02, 2020","permlink":"full-time-or-freelancer","body":"As a full-time employee, I am always fascinated with the thoughts of working as a freelancer because of the freedom I will get.

I am learning and thus sharing with you all. As you all know we all work to earn money and we all spend money on necessity, leisure, and luxury and also invest or save for the future. \n\nBut the problem arises when we spend more money than we think and thus have fewer savings or even no savings. When we have fewer savings, we will have less freedom in life, we have to stick in our boring or toxic job to pay the bills and cannot do on our own if we want. If we want to save more money we have to spend less. Thus the question arises, how to spend less.\n\n\n![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWQGrkLdhqR1fTMgNRxGRweWwjNt46322G9wT1RXU8Wxf/image.png)\nPC : Pexels.com\n\nJust thinking about spending less doesn't work. You cannot become lean just by thinking that you will eat less. One heck of eating less is to eat in small plates, you will feel full even if you eat less. Thus the same principle can be applied to spending less money. \n\nWhat we all know the savings, total income minus the expenses. But the problem is expenses are not limited and we usually spend money from savings and then we end up spending all, and thus we don't have anything to save. There are expenses from our Credit Card, EMIs etc. There might be your \"will power\" or \"discipline\" to save more money, but it doesn't work and thus you spend money for something or the other.\n\nSo to spend less we can have the method of the small plate that means, we must save money first and then whatever is left can be used for expenses. If you earn $1000 and plans to save 20% of your income then take $200 out of it and thus you have $800 available to do your expenses. This has o be done as soon as you get your paycheck. Thus you have a smaller plate and you will end up spending less. Trust me this is the best way to spend less because you have less money for your expenses and you will always find a way to manage from that expense.\n\nSavings first and then the expense, you can build a fortune in some years, and thus you will have freedom to come out of the toxic or boring job to start something on your own.\n\nIs there any other way to spend less, do let me know.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"hive-148441\",\"leofinance\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"gems\",\"ocd\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmWQGrkLdhqR1fTMgNRxGRweWwjNt46322G9wT1RXU8Wxf\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
