Now my web.config file has below code\n\n```add assembly=\"Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845DCD8080CC91\"```\n\n```add assembly=\"Microsoft.ReportViewer.WebForms, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845DCD8080CC91\"```\n\nTo Update, first remove the older dependencies from your project and then Install the newer version from the Nuget Package Manager Console Install-Package Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportViewerControl.WinForms\n\n2- I also added '&rs:embed=true' in the Report URL for all the reports\n\n3- Last thing I have added ```http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"``` for Compatibility for IE 11 and Edge in the aspx page.\n\nAlso Posted On My Personal Website : https://www.codingdefined.com/2018/08/how-to-fix-this-content-cannot-be.html","created":"August 13, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How I Fixed \"this content cannot be displayed in a frame in SSRS 2017\"","permlink":"how-i-fixed-this-content-cannot-be-displayed-in-a-frame-in-ssrs-2017","previous":{"title":"Indian Dessets","permlink":"indian-dessets"},"next":{"title":"Claim SteemHunt Tokens as per your Steem Power","permlink":"claim-steemhunt-tokens-as-per-your-steem-power"}}}}
