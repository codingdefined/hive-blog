Similarly, I have to do that yesterday. I was getting the DateTime in yyyyMMddhhmmss format which is a very common format in Java. Now I need to convert that to a JavaScript Date for doing some computation on the dates. \n\nThis is where I have to write a bad code where I have to slice Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minutes and Seconds and then using the date class converted it into the JavaScript Date and then computed it with other dates as shown below \n\n`Date.UTC($entity.updated.slice(0, 4), $entity.updated.slice(4, 6) - 1, $entity.updated.slice(6, 8), $entity.updated.slice(8, 10), $entity.updated.slice(10, 12), $entity.updated.slice(12, 14)) >= Date.now().minusDays(7)`\n\nThough I tried to write a good code by writing it in a function, because of SnapLogic limitation, have to write this in ugly format.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"developers\",\"steemdev\",\"india\",\"progamming\",\"coding\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"ba714102-4f64-53d8-a163-61056000ddc7","title":"Beautiful Sunday - Cricket Playing","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 07, 2018","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-cricket-playing-c5dfa78c00afb","body":"So today we went to play cricket after a long time.

There was a study in 2017 which has said that an average person spends more than 4 hours on the smartphone which includes surfing, entertainment, social media and what not. \n\nNow the main discussion for this post would be, in 24 hours how much time you use the smartphone. If it's over 4 hours in a day, then you need to significantly reduce it. Habits of checking smartphone every now and then will take time to change i.e. to become habits, but you need to start from somewhere. \n\nHow to start limiting yourself not to become a smartphone addict. At first, limit yourself that you will not do anything with your phone for more than 15 minutes (except talking). There are several apps which can remind you when your time is up. \n\nWith this small improvement, you will experience a lot of peace which will help you to make better use of your time like reading books. So start from today and limit yourself to become a smartphone addict.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"health\",\"discussion\",\"thoughts\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmPi3m95pePUVCuR7iHGDsxqiqn5tK6W2EHo4NMnw1UemP\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.statista.com\\/statistics\\/330695\\/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"97b0a336-2da5-5991-aff9-dcbfe1cf691a","title":"Home Made Cake","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 02, 2018","permlink":"home-made-cake-367111c56decb","body":"One of the problem vegetarian people like us face is that we do not get EggLess Cake so easily in the market.

Since there are so many blogs, posts, pictures floating on the internet that makes us think that we should also travel. And that's true also because no one wants to sit in the cubicle working for long hours a whole year. \n\nThis is where the secret comes into picture which will make your travel plan fulfilled if you want them by wholeheartedly. So the simple thing about your travel plan is that if you really want to travel you need to keep thinking about it. For me, I would keep all the travel itinerary sorted out, even sometimes I will book the tickets to make my travel happen. You are teh only one who can make the things happen. You need to save money, you need to book tickets and you need to start from something.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaWaPWYKfXpiomRfoSVYmanufBLYeXL4hSkKPExkYrDG7/image.png)\nPC : https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1444769\n\nAlong with planning you also need to sort out timings. Yeah if planning is done well you might get this sorted out, but still something or the other can come out at any point of time. You need to push yourself to make your travel happen, you need to think about the adventure, the sense of exploring which will make you push further. \n\nSo let's start with simple things, decide on a couple of destinations you want to travel. It should be nearby which can be traveled in a weekend for the starters. Then start saving for it based on the money you required for it.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"life\",\"discussion\",\"thoughts\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmaWaPWYKfXpiomRfoSVYmanufBLYeXL4hSkKPExkYrDG7\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pxhere.com\\/en\\/photo\\/1444769\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f386886d-9cb5-56d0-aa99-e8db858384dd","title":"How to beat Depression","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 22, 2018","permlink":"how-to-beat-depression","body":"Most of the people in their lifetime might have suffered from a serious mental illness and that is Depression, which not only creates a negative environment but has a negative impact on your health too. Now the main question arises is how to beat the depression. First of all, let's see if you are depressed or not, just head over to https://www.depressedtest.com/ and get your depression test done. You will get the scores like this, though I know that this values are not perfect but will give you some sense of idea about your depression level.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcHathsB5puEw69CsHpxmskT4A5y9LysgUpmTHEmApAiD/image.png)\n\nNow the real question arises is how to beat the depression. The best, as well as the effective medicine for beating depression, is to talk about it freely and openly to your close and dear ones. That is if ever you feel depressed just talk about your concern to someone who understands you or who can help you to overcome it. \n\nIn depression, people tend to remain sad and disturbed, but you should avoid it and try to do what you love or what makes you happy without disconnecting yourself from the world. The study says that if you do regular exercise or work-outs you can beat the depression really fast. Though in this fast-forward world you might have thousands of online friend, to come out of depression you need some real-life friends who encourage or motivates you to do better. \n\nThough in another way around if you see anyone around you is suffering from Depression, try to approach them and find out the root cause of it and then try to motivate them to move forward.

Is it so hard to say these sentences now-a-days I did wrong or I made a mistake? Why today being perfect is so important where no one wants to accept their mistakes. \n\nOne thing people do not understand that if you are not admitting the mistake you are increasing the stress in your life which is really bad for the healthy life. Since everyone is on social media now-a-days they are showing their perfect vacation, perfect home, perfect everything to the whole world even though the reality might not be the same, which is also making you stressed out. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSuK3FTV4PNYvGLkcjfHtBASTRDcQ33ZTqNQrWtmzQGY2/image.png)\nPC : https://www.flickr.com/photos/quoteseverlasting/8640869656\n\nWhen you realize that its OK to make a mistake, it will give you the strength to rectify that mistake. Otherwise, you will try to find ways to find out the middle way to run from your mistake which will eventually create a problem for you. It's on your hand if you want to stress out from your mistake or rectify it to live a better life.\n\nEveryone does mistakes, mistakes are part of life. But the best part of it is that it gives you tons of lessons on the life which will eventually make you a better person or you grow as a person. The beauty of mistakes is that it teaches you something or the other and these are the best teachers in your life. Though one will argue that what will happen to that person who does the same mistake again and again, does he not learning. Those people are leaning too, might be slow. \n\nRectifying your mistakes might take time, but you should not worry, just that you have to analyze it and fix with the best of your capability. You can take help from your family members or friends too because they can help you to improve your thought process and thus make you the better person after all.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"life\",\"discussion\",\"thoughts\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmSuK3FTV4PNYvGLkcjfHtBASTRDcQ33ZTqNQrWtmzQGY2\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/quoteseverlasting\\/8640869656\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a6509a74-ece1-54c8-937a-1be7c0003c8b","title":"Sunset in Ramnagaram","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 20, 2018","permlink":"sunset-in-ramnagaram","body":"This photo was taken above the hill in Ramnagaram.\n\n![IMG_20180908_172432-01.jpeg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmU7UcjFV3GPRngai7sMq6ucU22XFHSmStL4TFc755AVDE)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"goldenhourphotography\",\"india\",\"busy\",\"sunset\",\"photography\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmU7UcjFV3GPRngai7sMq6ucU22XFHSmStL4TFc755AVDE\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"a85bdc48-02d6-5365-b28d-7dc5f2999dc6","title":"A beautiful Sunset","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 17, 2018","permlink":"a-beautiful-sunset-1d99ce4ca3c06","body":"You get a lot of time being in hospital, I too got some time to click some photos.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/vqbsr2zapb.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/xmephwuuad.jpg)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/vqbsr2zapb.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/xmephwuuad.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"goldenhourphotography\",\"photography\",\"photo\",\"india\",\"photofeed\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":130,"numPages":74,"currentPage":14}}}
