Better be safe than sorry.\nSome of the things that I will do very soon are:\n\n- Stop using laptops and use more of desktops\n- Wear IMAK wrist gloves for typing\n- Get a standing desk\n- Use only mechanical keyboards\n- Use a ergonomic mouse\n- Invest is a very good chair with back support.\n\nAnd health wise:\n\n- Swim everyday\n- Weight training, 2-3 days a week\n- Stop non-veg food completely\n- 1 fruit juice a day\n- Plenty of water\n- Timely sleep cycle\n- Less sugar where-ever possible.\n- No intoxicants.\n\nHumans were not made to sit in front of the computer and work all day. Our bodies were designed to run and hunt for food. Working on a computer is very harmful to our health in the long term.","created":"August 04, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Some healthy tips for Computer Users","permlink":"some-healthy-tips-for-computer-users","previous":{"title":"SBD - Giveaway # 12","permlink":"sbd-giveaway-12"},"next":{"title":"FREE SBD GIVEAWAY, I WILL BE GIVING 4 SBD FOR FREE!!!ðŸ’ƒ","permlink":"free-sbd-giveaway-i-will-be-giving-4-sbd-for-free"}}}}
