It was not as difficult as it seems to be. I will share that in this tutorial how to get that Step by Step.\n\nIn my previous tutorial post [Send Message to Discord using Discordie NPM Package](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/send-message-to-discord-using-discordie-npm-package), I have told why I use Discordie. To get started with Discordie all the information are there on that post like Installation and the basics.\n\nNow when you are up and running with the Discordie you will get all the Users using the command `console.log(client.Users);`, but the drawback of using it is that it will give it as a IUserCollection.\n\n<center>![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514546819/hbm69pjcdtzkwvckncwc.png)</center>\n\nNow when we have all the IUserCollection to get the Users from it we can create a loop(forEach) to go through all the members in the loop like below:\n\n`client.Users.forEach(user => { });`\n\nWhen you try to get the contents of each user by writing `console.log(user)` you will get it as an IUser as shown below which has id, username, discriminator, avatar and bot which are discord properties. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514547259/bp1rjinpvt7t7sosz8hi.png)</center>\n\nBut along with this we have one more property known as status which will give me the status of that particular IUser as shown below :\n\n```\nclient.Users.forEach(user => {\n     console.log(user);\n     console.log(user.status);\n});\n```\n\n<center>\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514547602/hjyjtzmjj7imzioz5m0j.png)</center>\n\nSo you can filter out the Online Members with Offline Members, but there are methods to do it also if you know the channel id and guild id.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/get-all-the-online-members-of-discord-using-discordie\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"December 29, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Get All the Online Members of Discord using Discordie","permlink":"get-all-the-online-members-of-discord-using-discordie","previous":{"title":"Color Challenge - Friday Blue - Blue Sky","permlink":"color-challenge-friday-blue-blue-sky"},"next":{"title":"Lets Take a Morning Walk with me","permlink":"lets-take-a-morning-walk-with-me"}}}}
