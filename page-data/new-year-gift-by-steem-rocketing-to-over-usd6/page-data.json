I always changed my SBD to Steem because I knew one day or the other Steem price will go to Moon. At the time of writing this post Steem price is $6.31 which is 103.36% increase in 24 Hours as seen in CoinMarketCap.com. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf88ZCZKXWBj9BnnkYUWXPMgykeXcYdYsXxxvSoedt8kU/image.png)\n\nThis is the best gift Steemains can get on the New Year as your hard work value is just doubled from 3$ to 6$.  Just going through the Chart we can say it is not just a Random Pump, the price is going to stay and we will see the price of Steem to increase in near future. This is because of the awesome community as well as the new projects like SMT coming in. I hope by the end of 1st Quater Steem price will reach $10.\n\nWhat is your opinion about this increase?","created":"January 02, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"New Year Gift by Steem Rocketing to Over $6","permlink":"new-year-gift-by-steem-rocketing-to-over-usd6","previous":{"title":"Seven Days of Black and White Challenge - Day 4","permlink":"seven-days-of-black-and-white-challenge-day-4"},"next":{"title":"Comments with HTML Tags should be shown properly","permlink":"comments-with-html-tags-should-be-shown-properly"}}}}
