First of all for watching a sunrise I need to wake up early in the morning which I am not very fond of. Secondly, there are more dust, smog, and clouds at sunset and thus those elements diffuse the light, which makes it bigger and dramatic scenes. Whereas in the case of Sunrise,  the sky is clean and clear most of the time, thus you see Sun and its light everywhere.\n\nOne more thing everyone likes Sunset is that you can raise a glass to Sunset. Tea, Cofee, Alchohol, who drinks that at the time of sunrise, but most of the folks drinks it at the time of Sunset watching the scenes and enjoying the moment.\n\nFew Sunset Photos Clicked by me:\n\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQF9MbrrdiL9MmYPg7AoTFt4euGmfbGmNdEqcpVsY19Vr/IMG_20171110_180303.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQEwmp4SFzZsfecjSSs49Zg3THPTu7Dq5THr7pjgUoAG6/IMG_20180216_181424_2.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![image.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQCFZ5ahBfFwEDRv4pR81EMfDF94wMY4poUAqG6vKnTKZ/IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg)","created":"May 11, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"What is Better, Sunrise or Sunset?","permlink":"what-is-better-sunrise-or-sunset","previous":{"title":"Innovative Way to Ask People to Stay at Home","permlink":"innovative-way-to-ask-people-to-stay-at-home"},"next":null}}}
