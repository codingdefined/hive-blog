The problem now-a-days with lot of programmers including me is that we want to build projects but do not know how to start or go about it, like what technology to use or will it be successful or not.\n\nAlso some of us do want to start projects but are stuck about ideas. But to remind everyone that none of the idea is small or big if it solves someone's problem. For that problem your idea or solution will always be great. \n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXJYUkipNqU8J1vPTcDfj649yHnmfkz6fdDKsdDZQQFSp/image.png)\n[Source](https://pixabay.com/en/board-school-self-confidence-2433978/)</center>\n\nI learned the hard way that we should never think about whether the idea will be successful or not  but keep the confidence in me that hopefully my project will benefit that one guy who will use it. Thus its all about the mindset and confidence which helps you to build something. Confidence means that you are facing your fears or concerns and putting yourself out there and do something for yourself.\n\n\n\nConfidence is something where you have a small idea, you will go for it and work for it and try to make it bigger, I should quote too that \"Rome was not built in a day\". You should never over analyze anything and just go for it and start working on it because there is no way to know the future until and unless you step into the future. \n\nLet's take an example, I always thought of creating a Question/Answer website but thinking about StackOverflow and Quora I always hesitant about going for it. Thinking about who will us my website or how can I be better than those. But now I am motivating myself that whether a large number of people will be using it or not, may be there will be those 100 people who will benefit it from the website. \n\nIt will not be a failure for me because I know that I will be successful if I create a website, I will be successful if I get those 100 users using my website, I will be successful to know my website running.\n\nThus I will only say that Start working on your Project Ideas whether you will be successful or not, because failure is the new success.","created":"June 27, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Start working on your Project Ideas","permlink":"start-working-on-your-project-ideas","previous":{"title":"Food Photography - Meal With Live Football Screening","permlink":"food-photography-meal-with-live-football-screening"},"next":{"title":"The knockout stage is on! - Submit your entry to keep competing for the 2,000 SBD prize pool!","permlink":"the-knockout-stage-is-on-submit-your-entry-to-keep-competing-for-the-2-000-sbd-prize-pool"}}}}
