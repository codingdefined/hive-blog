So let's discuss both the aspects of it.\n\nLet's Say there are two freinds let them call A and B both earn $100 in a month. One save $50 and other did not save anything but he creates memories by enjoying his life from that $100. A being a conservative one does not go out to eat much, does not travel often and saves as much as possible whereas B is totally opposite of it.\n\nSo the question is should you become A or B. Both are good in their spending patters, one spend for future and other for his memories. Now since we all might have heard once that Life is Short, I.e. enjoy as much as possible, so if we think that way then B is good. Bit what if you live for 70 years and you dont want to work after 50 and just relax after 50 then the path taken by A is good.\n\nAs far as I know, you should live in your present and keep an eye on the future. That's what i do most of the time, I try to save as much as possible but not at the expense of today. What I meant to say I do save money for the future but not to retire early but just to play safe, though I enjoy my life too either by travelling or doing what I like. Since you cannot predict future you need to be prepared on both fronts, and that's what I try to do.\n\nLet's hear from you, what you think?","created":"November 28, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Discussion : Should you Save for your Future","permlink":"discussion-should-you-save-for-your-future-1a07620ca8415","previous":{"title":"Cat Fish in Lake","permlink":"cat-fish-in-lake-4d206947e9435"},"next":{"title":"A Security Breach in Quora ","permlink":"a-security-breach-in-quora"}}}}
