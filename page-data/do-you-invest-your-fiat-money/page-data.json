That means if you would have invested in NETFLIX, you would have got more than 5000% returns whereas if you would have invested on Amazon you would have got more than 1200% returns. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmau3aUgvBf1fTxQFhRg2BTUZNe2pW1b7QnAcNgVbRZB6h)\nPC: [HowMuch.net](HowMuch.net)\n\nLink of Article: https://howmuch.net/articles/1000-dollars-investment-in-stocks\n\nSo my question is do you invest your money in stocks? Have you ever considered that if you would have invested 10 years ago, you might be getting an exceptional return of your investment?\n\nThe stock market is very risky just like Cryptocurrency market, so have you found an alternative method. How about Investing in Recurring Deposit where you invest $10 every month to a bank to get a fixed return or investing in a mutual fund. \n\nYou might be thinking, I have not started earning 10 years ago so what should I do now. Then there is a famous line for you that\n\n>The best time to invest was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.\n\nThat is you should not think of past but start at the very moment i.e. now. Start investing as small as possible. Though along with the other investment, there is always an investment on yourself, start investing on yourself to gain knowledge which will help you to earn more in future.","created":"September 10, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Do you Invest your Fiat Money?","permlink":"do-you-invest-your-fiat-money","previous":{"title":"A Beautiful Flower Clicked on Beautiful Sunday","permlink":"a-beautiful-flower-clicked-on-beautiful-sunday-e577f8ff81484"},"next":{"title":"Do you often provide Constructive Criticism?","permlink":"do-you-often-provide-constructive-criticism-579e814d0eb0e"}}}}
