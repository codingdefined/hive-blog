You should be in your comfort zone until you feel the comfort zone is not comfortable anymore. But the real question is are you afraid of coming out of your comfort zone.\n\nhttps://images.pexels.com/photos/1412270/pexels-photo-1412270.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=comfort-zone-growth-1412270.jpg&fm=jpg\nPC: Pixels.com\n\nThere are a lot of people want to come out of the comfort zone to try something new but they are afraid about the consequences which will follow. For ex, you are in your comfortable job but wanted to do something of your own, that is actually meaning you want to take a risk of losing the job as well as might be losing the money of your new venture if that is not successful. \n\nPeople like me are always afraid to take this bold step because we know that we have a family which depends on us. Now this makes us a mediocre in front of people who has taken a risk and became successful. Until and unless you come out of your comfort zone you will not achive a great success in any field you are in.\n\nThus even if you are not able to come out of the comfort zone try to make your comfort zone uncomfortable. What I mean if you want to start a business along with the job you need to spend your extra time on your business and try to be in focus.","created":"July 06, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Are you afraid of coming out of Comfort Zone?","permlink":"are-you-afraid-of-coming-out-of-comfort-zone-8873ab06f8d2a","previous":{"title":"Steemleo - A New Scot Tribe","permlink":"steemleo-a-new-scot-tribe"},"next":{"title":"Focus for a little longer","permlink":"focus-for-a-little-longer-78e9e8e02afeb"}}}}
