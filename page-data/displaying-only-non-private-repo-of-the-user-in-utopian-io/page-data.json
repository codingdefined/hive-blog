It actually has a boolean field (true and false). If it is true that means it is a private repo whereas if it is false it means it is a public repo. So we need to show only public repository in the user profile and not private repo.\n\n ![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510661193/vfgbfnboh751tfyucqll.png)\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nTo fix the bug we need to check if the repository is not private using flag `(private === false)`. So in the below code at first we are checking if the repo owner id is the github account id and also if the repo is private or not. \n\n`res.json(repos.filter(repo => repo.owner.login === user.github.account && repo.private === false));`\n\nCommit : https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io/pull/23/commits/ad0911f03fd1c5e5b6db47e80a0d2df433271556\nPull request : https://github.com/utopian-io/api.utopian.io/pull/23\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510661320/ey3mydemvvkuynkxhdyf.png)\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Open Source Contribution posted via <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/displaying-only-non-private-repo-of-the-user-in-utopian-io\">Utopian.io</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 14, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Displaying only Non Private Repo of the User in Utopian.IO","permlink":"displaying-only-non-private-repo-of-the-user-in-utopian-io","previous":{"title":"Utopiian-io SCAM in Steemit.Chat asking for money.","permlink":"utopiian-io-scam-in-steemit-chat-asking-for-money"},"next":{"title":"How to Learn Programming - A Beginner's Guide","permlink":"how-to-learn-programming-a-beginner-s-guide"}}}}
