It is made up of powdered milk, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and oil.\n\n**Rasgulla -** The name Rasgulla comes from two words ras (\"juice\") and gulla (\"ball\"). It is made up of chhena where chhena mixture is formed into small balls and then these balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup.\n\n**Basundi -** Basundi is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half.
