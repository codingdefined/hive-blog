Almost all the business around the world got a hit in this crisis, but very few businesses still running smoothly like FMCG, Medical Supplies as well as telecom. I think among all that telecom is what people need especially the internet. \n\nIf I talk about myself, I am working from home where I need good internet for connecting to my office VPN. I have ACT broadband which is of 40 Mbps and that is sufficient for me because most of the time I don't connect to VPN. Though ACT Broadband is really good even in 40 Mbps, I didn't find any glitches what's ever.\n\nSo if I talk about ACT business, I really like the gesture they have sent to all the customers in these difficult times. I have got an email today as below :\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVq22HzdEtxEvRKyYPertekyntWp2XTXsqynjFen7oWBE/image.png)\n\nThis means I don't have to pay any extra for the whole month of April to enjoy Unlimited 300 Mbps speed. They have correctly said that \"We always strive to beat the expectations of our customers\". That's right because most of the businesses might be thinking of enhancing their profits, but ACT has done a wonderful job to enhance the customer relationship.\n\nAfter upgrading I am getting the below message in my ACT app, thus now I can enjoy higher speed for the whole month.\n\n![Screenshot_20200409-154400.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmeWocZGfyjW3SCSGvtBgt1sjYPbY8dUJp9J1Xuqpc1o5b/Screenshot_20200409-154400.png)\n\nACT has introduced these benefits to support the work from home culture and encourage people to stay at home. These benefits can be availed by anyone who has an ACT subscription. provided across the country, in all markets that ACT Fibernet operates.\n\nThis is a really nice gesture or a Gift. Have you received any gift in these difficult time?","created":"April 09, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Gift at the Time of Crisis","permlink":"a-gift-at-the-time-of-crisis","previous":{"title":"In Quarantine - Eat Healthy or Eat Right","permlink":"in-quarantine-eat-healthy-or-eat-right"},"next":{"title":"Importance of Saying \"No\"","permlink":"importance-of-saying-no"}}}}
