Some share the email ids or some might sell it, if they do it then you might get tons of spam emails.\n\n​This is where Mailinator comes into picture. Millinator is a free service which gives you an email address instantly and that email address will be destroyed after few hours.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcCc43nsgNRfo5UjMgtvyxDo8Do5B4FzU1gynkduAp4vp/image.png)\nPC : https://www.mailinator.com/\n\nOne more thing is that you can create as many as email address and just stop worrying about the spam emails. \n\nFAQ from their Website\n\n### >What is Mailinator?\n\n>The Public Mailinator site is a different kind of email service. The biggest difference is that you don't need to sign up. Any email name you can think of already exists @mailinator.com and you can use any of them. Want BrianTheSkink@mailinator.com? You got it. Want PrettyMothra? ScaryGavyn? No problem. Those and any other mailboxes you think of @mailinator.com are created when email arrives! Really. Other differences of the Public Mailinator system include:\n\n>All Emails automatically delete after a few hours\n>You cannot SEND from Mailinator - it is a receive-only service\n>All email is public. Really - very very public. All Email is readable by anyone and no one \"owns\" an inbox or emails.\n\nI think it is very good in terms of reducing the Spam Emails in your personal email addresses","json_metadata":"{\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"technology\",\"busy\",\"education\",\"free\"],\"users\":[\"mailinator.com\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmcCc43nsgNRfo5UjMgtvyxDo8Do5B4FzU1gynkduAp4vp\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.mailinator.com\\/\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"c1a04bc3-d7c0-5a72-8f9e-fe73a32b96ae","title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - A Blue Sky","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 27, 2017","permlink":"2zeexu-colorchallenge-friday-blue-a-blue-sky","body":"My entry for today's #colorchallenge is a blue sky.
