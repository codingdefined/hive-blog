Now when I searched the exact same words in Github it provided me more than 14000 projects which matched the term as shown below.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510397282/kuoqaor9wi1iwugaspla.png)\n\nThe result is sorted based on the score of the project as well as based on the stars they have received till now. Now in the Utopian we cannot show all the 14000 projects so we need to do the exact search of the name.\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nI have worked on Solr search before so I know that to make a search on exact terms the query should be encoded inside the quotes.\n\nSo instead of using `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=openv%2Fopenv+fork:true+in:name&sort=stars&order=desc` I have used `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=%22openv%2Fopenv%22+fork:true+in:name&sort=stars&order=desc`.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510397626/iwsx9iqf3rml9h7w1sny.png)\n\nThus as shown below it gives only 7 records and not all the 14000 records. Only thing you need to keep in mind that you are searching the repository with exact terms.\n\nPull Request : https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/76\nCommit : https://github.com/codingdefined/utopian.io/commit/0c93e60f498596a05e5586f95acbceb7f1da7e64\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Open Source Contribution posted via <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/searching-github-repository-on-exact-terms\">Utopian.io</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 11, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Searching Github Repository on Exact Terms","permlink":"searching-github-repository-on-exact-terms","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - Swimming Pool","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue-swimming-pool"},"next":{"title":"And again one more beautiful sky","permlink":"and-again-one-more-beautiful-sky"}}}}
