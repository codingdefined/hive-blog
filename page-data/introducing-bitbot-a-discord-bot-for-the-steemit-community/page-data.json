But it was unable to find the new tokens or some tokens. This was really frustrating a bit.**\n\nSo then we came up with an idea of making a bot that could find the prices of all the tokens. In this even we ran through a lot of ideas. And the bot is still in development. The bot will be completed soon. And it's looking good at the moment. The accuracy of the bot is very high. \n\n**We are just making it more advanced in-terms in finding the token you are looking.**\n\n# Bitbot Info:\nBitbot is an advanced version of Banjo. We knew that banjo can't figure out all the tokens and that it uses the **WorldCoinIndex**. Bitbot uses the CoinMarketCap for more accurate information. In few days the bot will be able to notify us when a new token is added in Coin Market Cap. This can help us keep track of the tokens and that you don't miss it. **The Bot is developed by @codingdefined**. \n\n# The bot commands: \nThe bot works with the \"$\" command. There are various commands for the bot. **Below are the commands list and what they do.**\n\n```Javascript\n1) $price <coin>\nThis will tell you the price of the token you asked for.\n\n2) $accounts\nWill tell you the total accounts in Steemit.\n\n3) $hot <tag name>\nThis will tell you the hottest post that is there with the specified tag.\n\n4) $trending <tag name>\nThis will tell you the trending post with the specified tag. \n\n5) $created <tag>\nThis will give you the new post that was made in steemit using the tag. \n```\n\n# Commands that we will be adding. \n```Javascript\n1) $top10\nThis will tell you the top 10 coins with reference to coinmarketcap data, \n\n2) $rank <number>\nThis will trigger the specified ranked token. Eg. $rank 1 (will trigger bitcoin)\n\n3) $new \nThis will let you know the latest token that was added to CMC. \n\n4) $latest <steemit user name>\nThis will find the recent of the latest post by the specified user. eg. ($latest manishmike10) \n\n```\n# What does this offer. \nThis bot offers the crypto enthusiast people to find the token that they are looking for. \n\nThis gives the benefit to the Curators to curate the new post and find the post they are looking for. They do not need to go to steemit to find the post. \n\n# Glimpses of usage. \n![Screenshot (262).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeiiWiBdqbJkmuhKwNMp3SFTmd6fqRCDP8DWowVwx3fAA/Screenshot%20(262).png)\n\n****\n****\n![Screenshot (263).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmS4C82poPGRyaRaqbTMod5Wn1RSfMHmxE24wJAxyxMEqs/Screenshot%20(263).png)\n****\n*****\n![Screenshot (264).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP6fce4P6DrEjdhrWLfuKTqiEVqVQvsP1nLBZErDVSSc3/Screenshot%20(264).png)\n****\n****\n### If you want to test the bot, feel free to DM me in Discord and I will invite you to the server.  (manishmike10#5313) my discord ID. \n## Until the bot is complete we will not invite many users in the server. \n****\n<br>\n****\n# We will let everyone use the bot in their servers soon. But before that, please comment down and let us know that you would like to use the bot in your server. \n### We need to know how many of us would love to have this bot in their server.","created":"October 04, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Introducing BitBot: A Discord Bot for the Steemit Community.","permlink":"introducing-bitbot-a-discord-bot-for-the-steemit-community","previous":{"title":"ðŸ“· #BeachWednesday - Digha Beach in West BengalðŸ“·","permlink":"beachwednesday-digha-beach-in-west-bengal"},"next":{"title":"ðŸ“· #ColorChallenge - Thursday Green- Greenery and a Crocodile ðŸ“·","permlink":"colorchallenge-thursday-green-greenery-and-a-crocodile"}}}}
