LetsDisc can solve the problem to keep everything on one place. One thing which will different for this project than other projects is that it will not be limited to Steem Users, you can login via any medium. Though you will have an option to Post on Steem. As of now you can Login, Register, Create/Edit Question, Upvote other users questions.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXAj11woaStQerBx7zWvFawro51KjgrN7baa8aBQVSDJk/image.png)\n\n#### Features Implemented\n\nCreate/Edit Question - You can create your question with just title and body, your Body will have a preview which will show whatever you have written in the Body.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSxbE8CjczZrgY7LKHeqcsyrhLsYpyuLjCCjCqPSJSoAp/image.png)\n\nViews and Upvotes - When someone views the questions, its view count increases though we keep track of that and the view will not increase if the same user again views the same question. Similarly for Upvotes and Downvotes we keep track of the user if he has upvotes/downvoted or not.\n\n#### Technology Stack\n\n1. .NET CORE 2.0\n2. C#\n4. JQuery\n5. SQL\n6.
