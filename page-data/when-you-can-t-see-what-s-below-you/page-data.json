The name Kodaikanal means \"The Gift of the Forest\" in Tamil, and you will see a lot of forest surrounding this hill station. I visited Kodaikanal in the rainy season as I want to see the beauty of it on a rainy day.  It did not rained the first day and the second day was full cloudy. Though it was a cloudy day, we thought it would be great to see some of the mountains and get good landscape photos. But we are presented with clouds everywhere.\n\n![_DSC0206.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeySqaSNdQvTe3YrSNHtrVDjEmHBLJoR5g3c8mHbaSRua)","created":"November 08, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"When you can't see what's below you","permlink":"when-you-can-t-see-what-s-below-you","previous":{"title":"Is there a Downvoters Gang or is it a Single Person","permlink":"is-there-a-downvoters-gang-or-is-it-a-single-person"},"next":{"title":"Do you focus only on one thing?","permlink":"do-you-focus-only-on-one-thing"}}}}
