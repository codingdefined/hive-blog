But yesterday I got a query from my friend and does arise the question that do you abandon your old dog. \n\n![qpdwcxyrx0.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/qpdwcxyrx0.jpg)\nPC: Today Show\n\nYesterday I had a discussion with my friend who is very frustated with his old dog as he has to take him to doctor every other day. He was thinking of abandoning the dog and asking me if I know any fog shelter. I asked him simple question will he abandon his parents if they gets old. He said no, because they are his blood relation.\n\nWhich made me think that does people value relationship only if they have blood relation. I think that heart relation should be valued more than blood relation. And our relation with the dog just like any other heart relation or I think it's better than any other because they are totally dependent on us.\n\nCoincidentally I have seen today morning that an owner taking his old dog for a walk. The dog was not able to walk properly even though the owner patiently walking with him. I could not get a picture otherwise I would have sent it to my friend telling that this is how you should take care of your dog rather than abondoning it. \n\nDog are the most loyal pet, they will love you unconditionally and it return they just want a little love. My parents don't like dog so because of that I cannot keep a dog at home but I make sure I feed some dog in the street. I get love from them too and thus I don't have to keep pet at home because they all are my pet.\n\nWhat's your thought?","created":"September 28, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Do you abandon your old dog?","permlink":"do-you-abandon-your-old-dog","previous":{"title":"Do you know about STF Funds?","permlink":"do-you-know-about-stf-funds"},"next":{"title":"Photoristic Travel to Mysore Palace","permlink":"photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace"}}}}
