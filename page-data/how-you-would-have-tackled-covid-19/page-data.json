The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. \n\nWe have seen how the US president has accused WHO of his inefficiency to tackle the virus. If you would have been in position of WHO Chief, how you would have tackled Covid19 or what steps you would have taken. \n\nThe efficiency which I think WHO lacked is:\n\n1. Strict measures to contain the virus\n2. Denial mode when the virus first came into light\n3. Have not sent the team to China's Wuhan to examine the virus\n4. No proper plan to save each and every country from Covid-19.","created":"May 01, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How you would have tackled Covid-19?","permlink":"how-you-would-have-tackled-covid-19","previous":{"title":"How to Spend Less","permlink":"how-to-spend-less"},"next":{"title":"Full Time or Freelancer?","permlink":"full-time-or-freelancer"}}}}
