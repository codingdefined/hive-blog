Since crypto is a little volatile it's better to invest some money which you do not want to lose it fully. \n\nThis is were the investment like Fixed Deposit, Recurring Deposit or Mutual Fund will come into handy. The problem with Fixed Deposit and Recurring Deposit is that though they are the safest option they give very less interest and for a long run that's not good. \n\nThat's why I tend to invest some portion of my income in Mutual Find divided into Debt and Equity. Debt for less risk and less return whereas Equity for more risk and more return. Since I divide into both the type of mutual funds I tend to minimize the risk whereas equalize the return. \n\nI am doing it from the last 2 months and though I am getting the negative return as of now but I know that in the long run like 5 to 10 years I will get enough returns to beat the inflation.","created":"July 26, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Why I am Investing in Mutual Fund","permlink":"why-i-am-investing-in-mutual-fund-51aef28591402","previous":{"title":"Introducing RealityHubs!
