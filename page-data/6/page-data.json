I remember going through the channel list in the newspaper to know the timings of my favorite cartoons. I remember we hardly go out to a fancy restaurant if we need something to eat we usually prepare at home. I remember we wait for our turn to read the newspaper being in a big family.\n\nNow with the technology advancement as well as everything online, we hardly do anything outside of it. Just to give you an example, I wanted to read a book called \"**Stay Hungry Stay Foolish**\" written by Rashmi Bansal which is about the stories of 25 marketing graduates who left their job to pursue entrepreneurship. I was actually searching for this book for quite some time (I know, I know, I can get it on Amazon.in but who will pay that much delivery charge for a single book), but could not find it offline. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPT3yU7DQkBiysmGXQN9GUFhwcuudSTgJSY6bPdEyC4Gz)</center>\n<center>PC: https:booksforthewise.com</center>\n\nMy friend suggested to read an Audio version of it or try reading it as an ebook. I tried both but to be honest reading a paper book has its own advantage. I am not a big fan of reading books online or listening to it. I could not get a feel, might be an older version of me has a greater role in it. But whatever it is, I don't think that Audio version of a book or a kindle book can ever replace a paper copy of a book. If I am reading a story, I can still consider Audiobooks as it can prove a good bedtime time pass but reading something to gain the knowledge I cannot imagine listening to Audiobooks.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\",\"lifestyle\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPT3yU7DQkBiysmGXQN9GUFhwcuudSTgJSY6bPdEyC4Gz\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"09b6fd64-ba52-53f6-b463-17c930339174","title":"Aren't we too tied with Technology","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 14, 2019","permlink":"aren-t-we-too-tied-with-technology","body":"Computers and Smartphones have made our life super easy, now we do not have to take notes, remember contacts or remember anything for that matter because Google is there. They are making our life super easy, so-called hundreds of Apps help us do so many things with a single click. We can contact and get an answer from any part of the world or help anyone even if we have not met that person.\n\nFor me the best part is Google Maps, I can take my motorbike and go to many places without having to worry about the path because hey Google has an outstanding map. Now in previous days, we used to remember each and every path we used to take so that we will not forget the route while coming back but that is not the case anymore because we have google to remember it for us. \n\nNow because of this great technology advancement, our life became a hell lot easier, we do not have to ask for routes anymore, we do not have to remember/write down contacts, taking notes became easier, easier to find places, etc. But along with that, there are a lot of disadvantages too, like now the human face to face interaction became nil, too many online frauds, a lot of time is getting wasted online by so-called social sites, etc.\n\nNow the question is aren't we too tied with Technology. On Saturday, I went to a meetup which is around 20 km from my place, even though I know the route I still have started Google Maps. Now suddenly Google Maps started behaving weird and giving all sorts of the wrong direction. Mind it, I had good internet connectivity on phone and I had used Google Maps in the past too.\n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmb26piJfN7naewEsboq5g2xX8qYxa1ZfydSSf8yJNiNqA)</center>\n\n\nSee in the above photo, the circle is where I am because since I know that route I have taken it. But egoistic Google Maps is still showing its old map. Now as a newbie who might not know the route can be easily lost because of this. Though it happened with me couple of times. So now what I usually do, is just confirm with someone that am I going in a correct path or not.\n\nNow you might be asking how come, looking at the Google Maps will make us tied to technology, then think about people going out some 10 years back. They did not had Google Maps as such still they used to reach their destination. In my opinion, what I feel is that we should not fully rely on the technology information provided by these apps fully.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmb26piJfN7naewEsboq5g2xX8qYxa1ZfydSSf8yJNiNqA\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"09a5e7b9-5744-5902-959b-5eb5ea3e9215","title":"Costly Dental Clinic","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 11, 2019","permlink":"costly-dental-clinic","body":"In India it's very unusual, mostly as far as I know, that you charge too much for your dental problems or I might not know the reality.

Vindyagiri is where the famous Gomateshwara statue is present.\n\nWe have started our journey from Bangalore around 6:00 AM in the morning and have taken SUR HASAN EXP (11311) to reach Shravanabelagola from Bangalore. As I have mentioned earlier train being the cheapest mode of travel, we usually take train and avoid getting our vehicle. The train started at 6:40 AM and we reached Shravanabelagola at 10:00 AM in the morning.

Since it was 1:30 PM we went to a nearby restaurant and had our lunch. After having lunch, we have started for Chandragiri Hill. Chandragiri hill does not get too much of a visitor because either people are not aware of it or they simply decide to skip it, but if you are in Sharavanabelagola it is worth to visit the hill. It has fewer steps than Vindyagiri, and we just have to climb around 270 steps to reach the top of the hill. Climbing the hill is relatively easy than Vindyagiri because it does not have steep stairs.\n\nIf you have to do photoshoot I would highly recommend this hill, it has everything which you need to cozy photoshoot.\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1935.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUTg2Ck3GXizpU9J4Tz6Z359t5q2rFEuho75aNxXhprkb)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1936.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmbpuut1yPqc9yqj3tPcrU2iKX2bef2YkCxsY1S12tYWVz)\n\n<hr>\n\nOut of the 106 memorials in Sharavanabelagola, 92 are located in Chandragiri hill.

From there we have again taken a tuk-tuk to reach the railway station. Our train SOLAPUR EXP(11312) was at 4:45 PM and thus we need to wait for around 30 minutes on the railway station. By looking at the railway station I must say, it is one of the cleanest railway stations, it might be because of a few people visiting it. Our train was on time and we reached Bangalore by 8 PM. \n\nThough the trip was tiring as we have to climb two hills, but it was worth it. \n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"creativecoin\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"zzan\",\"travelphotography\",\"travelfeed\",\"lifestyle\",\"oc\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQxRZPkyjdggw5SfnfUFXcVLeuZ7zXMD2BL1kgfZ2snpT\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQS5AQHkRNPVrz3YowHyUrQHxZWxUjVoJp3PiY7PoroeT\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTYc9A4vAsPvJKSZZT7yXacY1yRvh1Zqq19fKsu5Pka1P\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQgoZVsCdr2NHawtjQZ9eEV8BWq4D3wJntGeTgiLkNWZC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZJqWbaxtS1YCCxvr6ubyJRFDAzt9wqFMY6pdJpLjhk3r\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmW9wwSbeX8WfEqtpF8DnV2G4PQSsfyXMzPDQ1PtYEVTn6\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVZMmzbycMJts3613eFKpQQaJefxc42JfbydjgNjwuAPC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPqTgRWSFLaGBKdmqyTssk3KFQpxjVwQSsS4Km7tF1QQJ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQGLMQsNDWcZzXaNHLbLESHWhgtbmB5ttop54tnBDp1PN\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmX1sYYsbqtkWq3JMzLAjcckGLrGmPPgPfiF2jTii8WmVu\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdGrtaxrDMYdkytqRWvt7RqMySGtm1S9JYo2VYXM1joeq\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXsxrnU4UMLNkmLydTaaY1VHk7Yz3hzqmVjEyYYUg32CC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRpbtEAfWAcfqtGv4Hb9zxexetdFa2BvYCHU6SrkhX8Qw\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVkSf82eCKZZUEAswdEf6ZZV1kddnyxcsEPvXDvTaaEEg\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdnBEqryNVsurfHsnZ4rdMq7ZDZhAVyzs8hSb4Aq4gs69\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUTg2Ck3GXizpU9J4Tz6Z359t5q2rFEuho75aNxXhprkb\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmbpuut1yPqc9yqj3tPcrU2iKX2bef2YkCxsY1S12tYWVz\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWmYa4Smps2Q2CzmWVzMqzBPASkjzNSNcN5zPADHbqusa\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmS6wWaJ5KKXixLwZNsAMoqa7JfVETsckvLj2QT9TAGVys\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmU4sPQa6HuNuGVMgDqNgrPYUgHDChwKwDhkUMcay41BB1\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYTCwfGq1MyfPdqMUaFess95AMLP8NXyawhvxgGdBeW54\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTTe7giZt7GZw1hbEnjkPfUxL7JpNjn8owoj2ECrqCUa5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmcKBBKRskPSVmrw2zqc8FJPxEstsHEz7GFKAZQxBAQAps\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaZWyPqvnPJkfm25zCZEZNyxnriYVjPRqm3swG1FKLymw\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNVEKJwNU5WjKrva7quPoaftqt2Rakm7rG2ykdRWkgX96\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRtqczNb59g4KUY1eiJgx6ywS4UrTKTMWeEiAtuUpwse7\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaK5D4stFn6UaM8QgtS8a9HRk5wLqRJBRQzHXwiuMbtJf\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXFie6Bm9Hnf1YaZenqMvtVf3cdbuTUAUoHHc7M2u5Eyg\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"4f293a68-1436-59ce-9e1f-7697078f53e1","title":"Being Absent Minded","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 06, 2019","permlink":"being-absent-minded","body":"What everyone says is that being absent minded is form of a disease but I don't think so. Whenever you search for absent mindness on Google you get tons of articles claiming that you have this or that but that's not correct.\n\n![is6paqnaun.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/is6paqnaun.jpg)\n\nPC: iStockPhoto\n\nSo the question I would like to ask today is that are you absent minded?, Means you often forget where you have kept your bike keys or your phone or you constantly think that you have closed your door or not.\n\nIf you do any of the above things I would say that you are extra cautious or you are absent minded. It's not a disease though and you can overcome it very well. Just that you need to be more attentive and be less absent minded. \n\nThough people try to think that being absent minded is forgetfulness but that is not the case always, it can also be a case that you might be preoccupied with something and you became less attentive at that moment. That simply means you are distracted with external thoughts which might have caused you to become absent minded. It can be also because of tiredness and exhaustion after a day’s work or if you are in a hurry in the morning. It's not that people are absent minded all the times, you can be absent minded in certain situations.\n\nIf I take my example I always think while riding that if I have closed the door or not in the morning before going to office. This is because I am always in a hurry in the morning and have not fully focus at that very moment. Also today instead of booking a ticket for 10th Jan, I have booked a ticket on 17th Jan by being absent minded. Now if I have to give excuse I would say that I have to book around 4-5 tickets and because if that I lacked focus. \n\nNow you can't give excuse everyone because that will cost you money. I have lost around 10$ just by booking the ticket on the wrong date by being absent minded. Later I was thinking what was going on my mind, how can I lose focus as I always remain extra cautions while dealing with money. Though there are numerous reason, but today we will see how we can be extra focus while doing things so that we can become less absent minded.\n\nFew things which I have to follow, you can also follow if you are also absent minded just like me.\n\n1. Be attentive - While our mind is always think of one or the other thing but of we are doing something which needs our focus then we need to be more attentive at that very moment.\n\n2. Avoiding multitasking - This happened to me since I was busy playing with my kid and booking ticket I lost focus and thus done a mistake. So if you can you should do one thing at a time and then do other things.\n\n3. Have a sound sleep - If you don't sleep well at night, there is high chance that you will lose focus.\n\n4. Avoid being worry at all times because that will not free up your mind to do focus one other things, thus if you are doing something try to thing about that only.\n\n5. Last but not the least try to write down every important things you would like to do in a day so that you will not forget those and will finish it on time.\n\nAre you absent minded?\n","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/is6paqnaun.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"oc\",\"marlians\",\"lifesryle\",\"aaa\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"1aba1da6-4b40-5330-9c96-31c212ce0f09","title":"My 2-Day Budget Trip to Mysore from Bangalore","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 03, 2019","permlink":"my-2-day-budget-trip-to-mysore-from-bangalore","body":"Though Mysore is just 150 KMs away from Bangalore but it can become expensive if you are travelling with a toddler. There are quite a number of buses operate between Mysore and Bangalore which will charge you around 600 INR / 7$ for a one day trip to Mysore. But the problem with this type of trip operators is that they will give you limited time to explore the places and also they will take you to predefined places. \n\nThough if you are a budget traveller you can actually use these types of buses to visit important places in Mysore, but if you are travelling with a toddler it's better to keep some time in hand and explore the places at your own pace. This is what I have done. To keep my schedule less hectic I have taken a train to and from Bangalore to Mysore which comes 250 INR / 4$ to and fro. Since all the hotels have check-in at 12 PM, I have taken a train at 08:45 AM (MYSURU EXPRESS - 16316) which takes around 2 and a half hours from Bangalore. I have also pre-booked my hotel which came around 650 INR / 10$ since the discount was going on.\n\nI have started around 7:30 AM from my home, boarded the train and reached Mysore at 11:40 AM. You will get a lot of Tuk-Tuk from the railway station which will charge around 30-50 INR / less than 1$ to take you to the city centre. Since my hotel is very near to the Mysore Bus Stand, I paid the tuk-tuk guy around 50 Rs and he dropped me directly to the hotel. While my wife and kid were relaxing at the hotel, I have hired a Scooty from Bounce, which cost me around 500 INR + 200 INR for fuel / 10$, thus I don't have to pay those hefty amounts to tuk-tuk or taxis. \n\nWe have started around 12:15 PM from our hotel and reached [Mysore palace](https://steemit.com/india/@codingdefined/photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace). It took us close to 2 hours to complete the whole tour. As I have mentioned earlier that tour guys will give you only 1 hour to come back from Mysore Palace. So if you would like to explore, do take your time to view the artistic beauty of Mysore palace.  \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeKPiVCzZUkH6iPu4VEZYAfQEwhosmHPgDBGdg7h9Nbkj)\n\n\nAt 2:30 PM we had our lunch at the Veg Restaurant and then we went back to our hotel as my kid falls asleep. We again started from the hotel at around 5 PM to visit the Brindavan Gardens, we choose night time because there used to be a water fountain show at night. \n\n![IMG_1511.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmcfZ4sGSbTaNpYNRgYZJURkEgdCjMa82NP8sEZ3yEp4AL)\n\n![IMG_1528.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmb2gTv2MMHpPa31qiE9sGRunabgRaUM5BiLNSgkwsykSp)\n\nNot only that you will also to do boating around the lake. Please be informed that Brindavan Gardens also are known as KRSDAM or Krishnarajasagara Dam and very few people know it by Brindavan gardens. Also if you are using Google Map, it will take you to the back gate of Brindavan Gardens which remains closed so you need to ask people about the direction when you are around 2-3 KMs away from the Garden. At around 8 PM we have returned from Brindavan gardens and it took us around 40 minutes to reach Mysore, we had our dinner and we called it a day.\n\nWe have started Day 2 thinking where to visit first - Zoo or Chamundi Hills. We have settled it with Zoo because being a Sunday, Zoo might get crowded in the noon. The Zoo opens at 8:30 AM and we reached there by around 9:00 AM.\n\n![IMG_1643.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYHmZakQpHXtahEKovoso8C12s2UVEnqehpHAQpJNzQea)\n\nYou will see a lot of animals and it is one of the best Zoo I have visited, I can say it is much much better than Bannergatta National Park, Bangalore. My Kid enjoyed it and if you have a kid with you this is a must-visit. Also, note that the tour guys will not take you to the Zoo. \n\n![IMG_1566.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdXkjRE9kGYt8qSooer8gnKMzB7NzLPS21Q3FcT7ryzzQ)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1577.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmfQyec5tGTQBx5ayNp3wBQmo2RhumKTSu1zUBumBxvSaC)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1580.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPgbqwYejQh7SkburBFs7qVWdbWhGXPY1QHZrmQ5eczHG)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1591.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPt1TLU3MkYv1z2PwQSmhnckoyn47Sg6CXdC2YExHyheh)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1595.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUrbTe1EuTzCiBfK15RY5M942opqMF4BXx6ZHZDdd7JBL)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1608.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPwsBgMg7PqkRh3f3Y3rRseD8FaoL2VsxL8C9wt1H2u8F)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1633.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXUkhLNWeYUDQRKjp9CjvpR9X7XTaynSMQHDaqfWHifxb)\n\n<hr>\n\nIt took us around 3 hours to visit the whole Zoo and I must say we were tired like hell. We then went to Chamundi hills to visit the Chamundeshwari temple which is located at the top of the Chamundi Hills. Since there were too many people we have taken a ticket to get entry fast, I know its unethical but since we were having less time we need to take this route. You will love the greenery while going to the top of the hill and also you can view the whole of Mysore from the top. After reaching Mysore again we had our lunch, got our luggage and then dropped the vehicle and reached Mysore Railway Station. Our train was at 5 PM from Mysore and reached Bangalore around 8 PM.\n\nSo the cost involved are \n\n1. Travelling to and fro from Bangalore: 250 INR X 2\n2. Tuk-Tuk from Railway Station to Hotel - 50 INR\n3. Hotel - 650 INR\n4. Scooty - 700 INR\n5. Mysore palace Entry - 40 INR X 2\n6. Brindavan Gardens Entry - 15 INR X 2\n7. Mysore Zoo Entry - 60 INR X 2\n8. Chamundi Hills Ticket - 100 INR X 2\n9. Tuk-Tuk from Hotel to Railway Station - 50 INR\n10. Food - 1500 INR\n\nTotal - Around 4000 INR or 56 $. You can actually cut your cost more, like on food or Chamundi hills ticket. But for 2 people for 2-day travel to Mysore Rs. 4000 is OK.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travel\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"creativecoin\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"zzan\",\"travelphotography\",\"travelfeed\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/india\\/@codingdefined\\/photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmeKPiVCzZUkH6iPu4VEZYAfQEwhosmHPgDBGdg7h9Nbkj\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmcfZ4sGSbTaNpYNRgYZJURkEgdCjMa82NP8sEZ3yEp4AL\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmb2gTv2MMHpPa31qiE9sGRunabgRaUM5BiLNSgkwsykSp\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYHmZakQpHXtahEKovoso8C12s2UVEnqehpHAQpJNzQea\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdXkjRE9kGYt8qSooer8gnKMzB7NzLPS21Q3FcT7ryzzQ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmfQyec5tGTQBx5ayNp3wBQmo2RhumKTSu1zUBumBxvSaC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPgbqwYejQh7SkburBFs7qVWdbWhGXPY1QHZrmQ5eczHG\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPt1TLU3MkYv1z2PwQSmhnckoyn47Sg6CXdC2YExHyheh\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUrbTe1EuTzCiBfK15RY5M942opqMF4BXx6ZHZDdd7JBL\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPwsBgMg7PqkRh3f3Y3rRseD8FaoL2VsxL8C9wt1H2u8F\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXUkhLNWeYUDQRKjp9CjvpR9X7XTaynSMQHDaqfWHifxb\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"bace7857-3e5d-5c83-ae5f-83f84d836b83","title":"Photoristic Travel to Mysore Palace","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 01, 2019","permlink":"photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace","body":"I might have shared a few photos of Mysore palace, but today lets go inside the Mysore Palace and see how beautiful it is from Inside as well as from outside.

Also, Mysore Palace is the venue for famous Mysore Dasara where you can see a large possession happening at this time of the year.\n\nThe architecture of the palace is a mix of Hindu, Muslim and Rajput styles which states that it is built on Unity between all the religions in India. The palace is also surrounded by a large garden thus you will find greenery too if you are planning to do photoshoot out there.

He said no, because they are his blood relation.\n\nWhich made me think that does people value relationship only if they have blood relation. I think that heart relation should be valued more than blood relation. And our relation with the dog just like any other heart relation or I think it's better than any other because they are totally dependent on us.\n\nCoincidentally I have seen today morning that an owner taking his old dog for a walk.

I could not get a picture otherwise I would have sent it to my friend telling that this is how you should take care of your dog rather than abondoning it. \n\nDog are the most loyal pet, they will love you unconditionally and it return they just want a little love.
