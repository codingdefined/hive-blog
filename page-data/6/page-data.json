So I started from Bangalore to celebrate Diwali with my parents in Kolkata. As the flight ticket prices were skyrocketed in the festive season I have to take train which took around 35 hours. \n\nI started on Wednesday, and then reached Kolkata on Thursday. I celebrated Diwali and Kali Puja in Kolkata, few photos of the celebration\n\n![txddqbd91l.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/txddqbd91l.jpg)\n\n![tjyd27elg7.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/tjyd27elg7.jpg)\n\n![lwa9ksrzrx.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/lwa9ksrzrx.jpg)\n\n![hfnjhehg4f.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/hfnjhehg4f.jpg)\n\nThese photos are of 27th, the Diwali day. Then on 29 evening I started from Kolkata to Rajasthan to spend some time with my cousin's, as there was no direct train to Rajasthan Churu District, so i have to go through New Delhi i.e. Kolkata to New Delhi and then New Delhi to Churu which took around 40 hours as I have to stay 5 hours in New Delhi. On 31st morning I reached Churu and then around 10 AM we have started for visiting a temple which is around 130 Kms.\n\n![7kn70rgqrz.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/7kn70rgqrz.jpg) \n\n![9u4uchk8tv.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/9u4uchk8tv.jpg)\n\nAgain tiring day, we reached home around 7 Pm. The next day i have started again from Churu reached New Delhi and then taken a train from New Delhi to Chennai as i was not getting a direct train to Bangalore. It was around 34 hours journey and then waited 3 hours in the Chennai railway station to catch train to Bangalore. Again i have not got a reservation from Chennai so i have taken a general ticket which was equally crowded thus I have to stand around 6 hours to reach Bangalore. I have reached Bangalore in the Monday morning fully tired.\n\nAnd thus my tiring festive season came to an end.","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/txddqbd91l.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/tjyd27elg7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/lwa9ksrzrx.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/hfnjhehg4f.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/7kn70rgqrz.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/9u4uchk8tv.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"marlians\",\"lifestyle\",\"photography\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a88983d4-a794-5666-8529-45f8e5a2240d","title":"Created a Less risky and Moderate Profit Mutual Fund Portfolio","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 05, 2019","permlink":"created-a-less-risky-and-moderate-profit-mutual-fund-portfolio","body":"I am investing in a Mutual Fund for a long time like nearly 2 years, but recently I am following more and more funds to see which will fit for me. I am a very conservative investor where I only invest in schemes that are moderately risky that is more into debt and less into equity. \n\nAfter a year of investing in various schemes, I settled on 4 funds which I feel is more than enough for my needs and thus created a Portfolio in Groww.in so that more and more people can watch the portfolio and invest if they feel that their Goal is aligned with mine. \n\nThe funds which I am investing in are :\n\n1.

Though it's not limited to SIP, I sometimes invest lumpsum also. When I checked my portfolio today, I am sitting on a profit which is around 10% in the last one year, which is not bad at all because I know even if it goes down I will always be in a profit since the risk is not too high.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmT1de2RYPoFU7JS2a1R5eiobPUXBCfWw7JQhzj7WrWvk5)\n\nAlso, the length of my portfolio is Ultra Short Duration which means it will always give me profit in a short duration no matter what, thus I will always have my money in hand if I need it. \n\nSo anyone investing in  this less risk portfolio for 5 years, with Rs. 20000, they will easily get more than 15.5 Lakhs.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTuhiVe88rBvX8qJF15LqwkuB3D8Qe6bMddPxbALZKfar)","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"steemleo\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYjHZEEas9Z2Cnk5m3cF9bYd7dyQt5mSrPsYCTm2mFAjW\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmT1de2RYPoFU7JS2a1R5eiobPUXBCfWw7JQhzj7WrWvk5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTuhiVe88rBvX8qJF15LqwkuB3D8Qe6bMddPxbALZKfar\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"3877e17d-dcad-5f34-92b6-fa87c1ead87d","title":"A Simple bug turns out to be a Night Mare","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 22, 2019","permlink":"a-simple-bug-turns-out-to-be-a-night-mare","body":"How a simple bug in one of the open-source project which I was working on turns out to be a nightmare though not literally. It all started with me talking to the project owner to allow me to work on it. \n\nThe change was small, that is I have to check if the props are passing the read-only value or not and based on that I will show the toolbar. Sounds a simple right, I thought the same, thus written the code as \n\n`!props.readOnly && <MyComponent ..... />`\n\nWhat the above code will do it will check if the readOnly is true, it will not show the component if its false it will show the component. So far so good, I was able to fix it. Now the project owner wanted me to add a button on the parent component, which will toggle this behavior. That means based on button click I will show the toolbar or not.\n\nEasy-peasy, that's what I thought. So I have created a button and written a toggle function. And It was working for the first time, that is hiding the toolbar but the toolbar was not showing when I was clicking the button again. That's when the problem started, I was just scratching my head that what possibly can go wrong in a simple button.\n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPtSva6sg3rX9oHhnHtdo9Rr2xWaUi9q8NHXD7MuBvBYF)</center>\nPC : https://me.me\n\nAfter like 2 hours of overthinking, I fixed the bug. What was happening is that to rerender the child component, there should be some kind of event which has to be passed to child component and readOnly props was not doing it. So what I have done is to create a key, and in every button click I was sending a new key to the component. \n\nVoila !!! my code worked again. It's always nice to learn something new and I can proudly say that I have learned that today :)","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/me.me\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPtSva6sg3rX9oHhnHtdo9Rr2xWaUi9q8NHXD7MuBvBYF\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"52dd600a-6369-5ae2-986c-9e681e894f73","title":"In House Photos of Deo Bottle","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 20, 2019","permlink":"in-house-photos-of-deo-bottle","body":"A lazy Sunday has got better of me, I wanted to go out today for a trek but did not wake up in time.

I remember going through the channel list in the newspaper to know the timings of my favorite cartoons. I remember we hardly go out to a fancy restaurant if we need something to eat we usually prepare at home. I remember we wait for our turn to read the newspaper being in a big family.\n\nNow with the technology advancement as well as everything online, we hardly do anything outside of it. Just to give you an example, I wanted to read a book called \"**Stay Hungry Stay Foolish**\" written by Rashmi Bansal which is about the stories of 25 marketing graduates who left their job to pursue entrepreneurship. I was actually searching for this book for quite some time (I know, I know, I can get it on Amazon.in but who will pay that much delivery charge for a single book), but could not find it offline. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPT3yU7DQkBiysmGXQN9GUFhwcuudSTgJSY6bPdEyC4Gz)</center>\n<center>PC: https:booksforthewise.com</center>\n\nMy friend suggested to read an Audio version of it or try reading it as an ebook. I tried both but to be honest reading a paper book has its own advantage. I am not a big fan of reading books online or listening to it. I could not get a feel, might be an older version of me has a greater role in it. But whatever it is, I don't think that Audio version of a book or a kindle book can ever replace a paper copy of a book. If I am reading a story, I can still consider Audiobooks as it can prove a good bedtime time pass but reading something to gain the knowledge I cannot imagine listening to Audiobooks.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\",\"lifestyle\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPT3yU7DQkBiysmGXQN9GUFhwcuudSTgJSY6bPdEyC4Gz\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"da462f19-d893-5d28-bf13-f9082c8225ef","title":"Aren't we too tied with Technology","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 14, 2019","permlink":"aren-t-we-too-tied-with-technology","body":"Computers and Smartphones have made our life super easy, now we do not have to take notes, remember contacts or remember anything for that matter because Google is there. They are making our life super easy, so-called hundreds of Apps help us do so many things with a single click. We can contact and get an answer from any part of the world or help anyone even if we have not met that person.\n\nFor me the best part is Google Maps, I can take my motorbike and go to many places without having to worry about the path because hey Google has an outstanding map. Now in previous days, we used to remember each and every path we used to take so that we will not forget the route while coming back but that is not the case anymore because we have google to remember it for us. \n\nNow because of this great technology advancement, our life became a hell lot easier, we do not have to ask for routes anymore, we do not have to remember/write down contacts, taking notes became easier, easier to find places, etc. But along with that, there are a lot of disadvantages too, like now the human face to face interaction became nil, too many online frauds, a lot of time is getting wasted online by so-called social sites, etc.\n\nNow the question is aren't we too tied with Technology. On Saturday, I went to a meetup which is around 20 km from my place, even though I know the route I still have started Google Maps. Now suddenly Google Maps started behaving weird and giving all sorts of the wrong direction. Mind it, I had good internet connectivity on phone and I had used Google Maps in the past too.\n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmb26piJfN7naewEsboq5g2xX8qYxa1ZfydSSf8yJNiNqA)</center>\n\n\nSee in the above photo, the circle is where I am because since I know that route I have taken it. But egoistic Google Maps is still showing its old map. Now as a newbie who might not know the route can be easily lost because of this. Though it happened with me couple of times. So now what I usually do, is just confirm with someone that am I going in a correct path or not.\n\nNow you might be asking how come, looking at the Google Maps will make us tied to technology, then think about people going out some 10 years back. They did not had Google Maps as such still they used to reach their destination. In my opinion, what I feel is that we should not fully rely on the technology information provided by these apps fully.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmb26piJfN7naewEsboq5g2xX8qYxa1ZfydSSf8yJNiNqA\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"85161a96-7b6d-5f1d-b25e-312e6f744a69","title":"Costly Dental Clinic","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 11, 2019","permlink":"costly-dental-clinic","body":"In India it's very unusual, mostly as far as I know, that you charge too much for your dental problems or I might not know the reality.

Chandragiri hill does not get too much of a visitor because either people are not aware of it or they simply decide to skip it, but if you are in Sharavanabelagola it is worth to visit the hill. It has fewer steps than Vindyagiri, and we just have to climb around 270 steps to reach the top of the hill.

From there we have again taken a tuk-tuk to reach the railway station. Our train SOLAPUR EXP(11312) was at 4:45 PM and thus we need to wait for around 30 minutes on the railway station. By looking at the railway station I must say, it is one of the cleanest railway stations, it might be because of a few people visiting it. Our train was on time and we reached Bangalore by 8 PM. \n\nThough the trip was tiring as we have to climb two hills, but it was worth it. \n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"creativecoin\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"zzan\",\"travelphotography\",\"travelfeed\",\"lifestyle\",\"oc\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQxRZPkyjdggw5SfnfUFXcVLeuZ7zXMD2BL1kgfZ2snpT\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQS5AQHkRNPVrz3YowHyUrQHxZWxUjVoJp3PiY7PoroeT\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTYc9A4vAsPvJKSZZT7yXacY1yRvh1Zqq19fKsu5Pka1P\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQgoZVsCdr2NHawtjQZ9eEV8BWq4D3wJntGeTgiLkNWZC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZJqWbaxtS1YCCxvr6ubyJRFDAzt9wqFMY6pdJpLjhk3r\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmW9wwSbeX8WfEqtpF8DnV2G4PQSsfyXMzPDQ1PtYEVTn6\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVZMmzbycMJts3613eFKpQQaJefxc42JfbydjgNjwuAPC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPqTgRWSFLaGBKdmqyTssk3KFQpxjVwQSsS4Km7tF1QQJ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQGLMQsNDWcZzXaNHLbLESHWhgtbmB5ttop54tnBDp1PN\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmX1sYYsbqtkWq3JMzLAjcckGLrGmPPgPfiF2jTii8WmVu\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdGrtaxrDMYdkytqRWvt7RqMySGtm1S9JYo2VYXM1joeq\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXsxrnU4UMLNkmLydTaaY1VHk7Yz3hzqmVjEyYYUg32CC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRpbtEAfWAcfqtGv4Hb9zxexetdFa2BvYCHU6SrkhX8Qw\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVkSf82eCKZZUEAswdEf6ZZV1kddnyxcsEPvXDvTaaEEg\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdnBEqryNVsurfHsnZ4rdMq7ZDZhAVyzs8hSb4Aq4gs69\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUTg2Ck3GXizpU9J4Tz6Z359t5q2rFEuho75aNxXhprkb\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmbpuut1yPqc9yqj3tPcrU2iKX2bef2YkCxsY1S12tYWVz\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWmYa4Smps2Q2CzmWVzMqzBPASkjzNSNcN5zPADHbqusa\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmS6wWaJ5KKXixLwZNsAMoqa7JfVETsckvLj2QT9TAGVys\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmU4sPQa6HuNuGVMgDqNgrPYUgHDChwKwDhkUMcay41BB1\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYTCwfGq1MyfPdqMUaFess95AMLP8NXyawhvxgGdBeW54\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTTe7giZt7GZw1hbEnjkPfUxL7JpNjn8owoj2ECrqCUa5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmcKBBKRskPSVmrw2zqc8FJPxEstsHEz7GFKAZQxBAQAps\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaZWyPqvnPJkfm25zCZEZNyxnriYVjPRqm3swG1FKLymw\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNVEKJwNU5WjKrva7quPoaftqt2Rakm7rG2ykdRWkgX96\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRtqczNb59g4KUY1eiJgx6ywS4UrTKTMWeEiAtuUpwse7\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaK5D4stFn6UaM8QgtS8a9HRk5wLqRJBRQzHXwiuMbtJf\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXFie6Bm9Hnf1YaZenqMvtVf3cdbuTUAUoHHc7M2u5Eyg\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"e22066c5-4069-52f6-acaa-c71ebff273bd","title":"Being Absent Minded","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 06, 2019","permlink":"being-absent-minded","body":"What everyone says is that being absent minded is form of a disease but I don't think so. Whenever you search for absent mindness on Google you get tons of articles claiming that you have this or that but that's not correct.\n\n![is6paqnaun.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/is6paqnaun.jpg)\n\nPC: iStockPhoto\n\nSo the question I would like to ask today is that are you absent minded?, Means you often forget where you have kept your bike keys or your phone or you constantly think that you have closed your door or not.\n\nIf you do any of the above things I would say that you are extra cautious or you are absent minded. It's not a disease though and you can overcome it very well. Just that you need to be more attentive and be less absent minded. \n\nThough people try to think that being absent minded is forgetfulness but that is not the case always, it can also be a case that you might be preoccupied with something and you became less attentive at that moment. That simply means you are distracted with external thoughts which might have caused you to become absent minded. It can be also because of tiredness and exhaustion after a day’s work or if you are in a hurry in the morning. It's not that people are absent minded all the times, you can be absent minded in certain situations.\n\nIf I take my example I always think while riding that if I have closed the door or not in the morning before going to office. This is because I am always in a hurry in the morning and have not fully focus at that very moment. Also today instead of booking a ticket for 10th Jan, I have booked a ticket on 17th Jan by being absent minded. Now if I have to give excuse I would say that I have to book around 4-5 tickets and because if that I lacked focus. \n\nNow you can't give excuse everyone because that will cost you money. I have lost around 10$ just by booking the ticket on the wrong date by being absent minded. Later I was thinking what was going on my mind, how can I lose focus as I always remain extra cautions while dealing with money. Though there are numerous reason, but today we will see how we can be extra focus while doing things so that we can become less absent minded.\n\nFew things which I have to follow, you can also follow if you are also absent minded just like me.\n\n1. Be attentive - While our mind is always think of one or the other thing but of we are doing something which needs our focus then we need to be more attentive at that very moment.\n\n2. Avoiding multitasking - This happened to me since I was busy playing with my kid and booking ticket I lost focus and thus done a mistake. So if you can you should do one thing at a time and then do other things.\n\n3. Have a sound sleep - If you don't sleep well at night, there is high chance that you will lose focus.\n\n4. Avoid being worry at all times because that will not free up your mind to do focus one other things, thus if you are doing something try to thing about that only.\n\n5. Last but not the least try to write down every important things you would like to do in a day so that you will not forget those and will finish it on time.\n\nAre you absent minded?\n","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/is6paqnaun.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"oc\",\"marlians\",\"lifesryle\",\"aaa\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":50,"numPages":75,"currentPage":6}}}
