I came accross a site called Virwox which allows you to do the conversion between the Paypal money and the Bitcoin.\n\nUsing [Virwox]() is not as simple as it looks. At first, you need to Buy SLL (Second Life Linden Dollars) using your currency through the SLL/USD exchange. Now when you have the SLL you can buy Bitcoin using the SLL/BTC exchange.  \n\nThe only disadvantage which I feel using this system is the High Fees. Just look at the fees below. So If I want to convert from USD to Bitcoin 100 SLL is the fixed fees (two exchange USD/SLL and SLL/BTC) and then the variable fees.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXkEYqKZsNgcUVt7ou9mdX2N2qCh2igqSaqSD1QWM8qyE/image.png)\n\nPC : Virwox.com\n\nBut wait not only that, there is a fees on withdrawal also which is 0.001BTC per BTC (A handling fee of 0.001 BTC per bitcoin withdrawal will be charged).\n\nThe advantage of using it is the Security. They are one of the most secure websites out there. Even if the advantage is very less as compared to the disadvantage but I feel there is a way by which I can send the money over to Bitcoin Wallet using the Paypal.\n\nHave you tried Virwox, if yes please share the experience with us.","json_metadata":"{\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"crypto\",\"bitcoin\",\"cryptocurrency\",\"busy\",\"india\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmXkEYqKZsNgcUVt7ou9mdX2N2qCh2igqSaqSD1QWM8qyE\\/image.png\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"90b46fdb-18df-5f96-8096-4b01a94575d2","title":"Life of a Software Engineer","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 16, 2017","permlink":"life-of-a-software-engineer","body":"A software engineer is a most envied person in the whole world. It is not because of the educational background or the type of work he do – it is mainly because of his life style. Now I am going to list out some of the outstanding features of a software engineer’s life right from the initial phase to the fully developed product.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdHEetQfnQJtYcPWecmtNogc5XZyMFjehpV3RaXsdq4PX/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/artificial-intelligence-robot-ai-ki-2167835/)\n\nMost of us almost have our tags around our neck or in our belts all the time, even when we are out of work. When we walk, when we eat or when we drink. Only some of us are born with silver spoon and rest of us are born with our tags. Sounds funny, but a real fact.\n\nYou know what’s our favorite web site? its google and other search engines. If one day, these search engines goes down – almost every software company around the world is going to face a heavy productivity loss.\n\nBugs are our dear buddies. They are the byproducts of the software we develop. Those who test our software has the habit of filling bugs and we have the habit of saying it’s a feature or its working as expected. Of course we don’t say it all the time, we say it only when we can’t fix the bug. These are the people who are ours biggest night mare.\n\nWorkaround is one common word you are going to hear from us. In simple terms for an example, if we cannot write a program to sum one and one to get two, we will just write a program that’s sum up five and tem, then subtract thirteen from it. Please don’t ask why we do it, it’s a workaround.\n\nWe provide job opportunities to thousands of people around the world. As we are unable to perform our day to day errands due to our work nature. Hence, eventually, there are a lot of third party companies coming up who help us pay our bills, book our tickets and helps us do our basic works. Aren’t we great??\n\nApart from alcoholics, smokers and other forms of people, we also have special kind of people in our industry who are called workaholics. They are special breed of people whom you can find in office any time of the day including weekends. If we drill down to the cause of this issue, we also get to know this is because of the difference between “hard workers” and “people who hardly work”.\n\nFor us, any word with a “e-” as a suffix is quite interesting. We like emails, we work in e-commerce, we book tickets by e-booking. I honestly guess, there should some “e-food” or “e-family” research going on some part of the globe so one day we have everything in “e-“.\n\nWe won’t die if we don’t have air or food or water or shelter. But, we are sure to die if you don’t let us be connected to the internet.\n\nTo conclude I would only like to say that \n\n>“Life of a software engineer can be summarized in twelve words – in right and left click, they live a life without any life\"\nBy Saravana Kumar Murugan\n\nReference : From the web","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"blog\",\"funny\",\"india\",\"writing\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmdHEetQfnQJtYcPWecmtNogc5XZyMFjehpV3RaXsdq4PX\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/artificial-intelligence-robot-ai-ki-2167835\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f03ba937-5f7f-589d-859f-9fa0e29154f7","title":"Spring or Autumn?

To take a good photo you do not need a DSLR or something, a normal camera can take great image as well. You need to keep in mind few things when taking images. In that one important factor is the focus. Focussing on the right object can make a image from good to great. Let me show you an example.\n\nThe below image is the first image where the focus is kept on the sky. When the focus is on the sky, the trees are hardly visible and all are almost black in colour.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus1.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYvaEVtJcv6juv1ujmfGAhMzuhDcDSFEfeNUuXdfauQ3e/IMG_20171011_173504.jpg)\n\nThe below image is the second image where the focus is kept on the trees. When the focus is on the trees, the sky just glooms out in which you can hardly see the sun.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQJ5A9krHJu2pYCUiMsF7uPHvfrLYCoU4u3V6JP7Hpanr/IMG_20171011_173525.jpg)\n\nThis is the picture perfect where the focus is one the edge of the sky and the trees, thus you can see clearly the sun as well as teh trees. And since it was raining on that day, you can also see the water droplets.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmepxLsmP3unuLYiMPDBFXP8RpusRKbpY8TQi2QCVkDKkT/IMG_20171011_173457.jpg)\n\nNow when you have the image you can do some editing, like colour enhancement, contrast, brightness to make this image a little more soothing. In my next post I will show how to edit the image from your Smartphone itself. So after the editing the above image will look like below :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYoASWcFbZKKPQdv8FiYC92qb1bEUN9BTG223KvBhmkcy/image.png)\n\nThe above image is also shared [here](https://steemit.com/colorchallenge/@codingdefined/colorchallenge-thursday-green-trees-in-rain-20171012t12010563z)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>All the images are taken from Nokia 6 Camera</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>\n\n<hr>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"art\",\"creativity\",\"tutorial\",\"ocd-resteem\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYvaEVtJcv6juv1ujmfGAhMzuhDcDSFEfeNUuXdfauQ3e\\/IMG_20171011_173504.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQJ5A9krHJu2pYCUiMsF7uPHvfrLYCoU4u3V6JP7Hpanr\\/IMG_20171011_173525.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmepxLsmP3unuLYiMPDBFXP8RpusRKbpY8TQi2QCVkDKkT\\/IMG_20171011_173457.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYoASWcFbZKKPQdv8FiYC92qb1bEUN9BTG223KvBhmkcy\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/colorchallenge\\/@codingdefined\\/colorchallenge-thursday-green-trees-in-rain-20171012t12010563z\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"cff7be38-0af2-5233-b050-af652dd3b58a","title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - Blue Sky","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 13, 2017","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue-blue-sky-20171013t161915153z","body":"I enjoy taking Sunset with my Mobile Camera as there are so many colours all around.
