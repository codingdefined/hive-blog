However, Unocoin has not planned or equipped to support other shorter and weaker chains if they pop up.\n\nWe would be sharing a detailed maintenance schedule of our website for July 30th - 4th August to avoid any loss of customer's coins via replay attacks and to choose the longer and safer chain to go with. We may have to extend this maintenance if the need be. User's are always recommended to hold their coins with themselves for complete authority/choice of chain over the network split instead of holding them in their Unocoin wallets.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTpe6dvZzv2ZANUeMSqAqh4VtgcD3kuFTfzQz5W1QtCWp/image.png)\n\nThey also recommended to send the bitcoin holdings into a paper/hardware/software wallet which is in your possession and you control their private keys.\n\nWhat's your take on this ?","created":"July 28, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Indian Bitcoin Wallet Unocoin has an update for you","permlink":"indian-bitcoin-wallet-unocoin-has-an-update-for-you","previous":{"title":"#colorchallenge - Friday blue","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue"},"next":{"title":"A View of a Monsoon Season in India","permlink":"a-view-of-a-monsoon-season-in-india"}}}}
