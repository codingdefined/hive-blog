The traffic was totally out of control just one day before the G20 summit should start because Donald Trump landed today and blocked the whole city centre. I was stuck in traffic for three hours and needed to park outside the area and take the train to reach my destination. I really want to mention that the police officer are doing a great job. You see police trucks, weapons and officers everywhere. In addition at least five helicopters are circling around the town to protect the world leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>--------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>\n<h3>I took some pictures out of my car window to show you what happened today.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>I literally was staying in that position for over 30 minutes without moving a centimeter!

This would completely wipe out the need for polluting fossil fuels and revolutionise how we think about and use energy.  One company from the UK is trying to do just that—with the help of a special type of flooring.</p>\n\n<h2>Pavegen’s V3 Flooring</h2>\n\n<p>UK company Pavegen, has developed a special floor tile which generates electricity whenever someone walks over it. As people step on the tiles, their weight pushes down on electromagnetic induction generators causing them to move. The kinetic energy is then transferred into off-grid electricity which is stored in batteries.</p>\n\n<center><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sby4GR0sD8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></center>\n\n<h2>The idea</h2>\n\n<p>Laurence Kemball-Cook, the founder of Pavegen, came up with the idea after doing a placement year at the energy company Eon. He was given the task of finding a way to power street lighting with solar energy and wind. But due to constraints such as a lack of sunlight and temperamental weather, he couldn’t find a solution. Instead, he started thinking about other potential sources of power in urban environments. It was here that the idea for an energy harnessing floor was born.</p>\n\n<p>Given its usability, you’d think companies would have jumped at the chance to install this smart floor. However, after developing the technology it took Kemball-Cook several years to convince people to take it on. Speaking to The Guardian on how he got his first deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup\">he said</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Investors wouldn’t invest without tiles in the ground, so I broke into a building site on the south bank of the Thames at 2am, installed the product illegally, took photos and put them on our website saying: ‘Celebrating our latest installation.’ I closed a deal with Westfield pretty soon after that.</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Projects around the world</h2>\n\n<p>Since then, Pavegen has completed over 150 projects around the world, across various sectors including train stations, shopping centres, airports and public spaces. It’s also worked with brands like Coca-Cola and Siemens.</p>\n\n<p>It’s most recent installations were in West End London and in Heathrow Airport.</p>\n\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GSoTEhk.jpg\"/></p></center>\n\n<blockquote>Our Head of Comms (at)alexmwjohnson filming with (at)fastcompany today at our latest install in the heart of London's West End! Discussing how we are creating a smart, sustainable oasis just off one of the busiest areas in the city 🇬🇧 The project is launching soon - watch this space!</blockquote>\n\n<p>Photo: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZxp0-l0_t/\">Instagram</a></p>\n\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oimvzTj.jpg\"/></p></center>\n\n<blockquote>As people jet off on their holidays, they also contribute to powering the lights at @heathrow_airport through their footsteps👣 ✈️ Look out for us in Terminal 3!</blockquote>\n\n<p>Photo: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BT6eAnLFKWc/\">Instagram</a></p>\n\n<h2>Data collection</h2>\n\n<p>As well as producing electricity, the floor tiles also collect data. This data can then be used to measure footfall, predict peak timings and prime locations, ideal information for surrounding businesses like shops, cafes and restaurants. Likewise, anyone who steps on the tiles who is connected via a mobile APP collects points. Each footstep collected is converted into a digital currency that can be used to reward loyalty or to donate to charitable causes.</p>\n\n<p>Pavegen’s smart flooring appears a fantastic invention which has got people excited about alternative sources of energy. It’s not only encouraging people to walk in cities, rather than drive or take the bus, but also to think about energy consumption and how we can reduce our impact on the environment. Better for our health, better for the planet.</p>\n\n<p><em>Featured image: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pavegen/\">Facebook</a></em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://www.adaptnetwork.com/\">adaptnetwork.com</a> | Inspiring life's adventure</p></center>\n\n</html>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"science\",\"technology\",\"life\",\"environment\"],\"users\":[\"heathrow\"],\"image\":[\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/zT9YvOL.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/_sby4GR0sD8\\/0.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/GSoTEhk.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/oimvzTj.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/embed\\/_sby4GR0sD8\",\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/technology\\/2015\\/jan\\/11\\/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup\",\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/p\\/BVZxp0-l0_t\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/p\\/BT6eAnLFKWc\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/pavegen\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.adaptnetwork.com\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"html\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a05194cd-f3d6-58da-8a64-10f24d1d9335","title":"Steemvoter Guild: \"Nominate-a-Friend\" for the Guild Vote (Thursday July 6)","author":"steemvoter","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"4cteeo-steemvoter-guild-nominate-a-friend-for-the-guild-vote-tuesday-july-4","body":"<center>https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/06/09/10/00/smartphone-1445489_960_720.jpg</center>\n\n## Previous first place winner - [Struggles of An Indian Girl | Before Birth To After School | Personal Experience | Part 1 - 3 by @indian-mom](https://steemit.com/life/@indian-mom/struggles-of-an-indian-girl-or-before-birth-to-after-school-or-personal-experience-or-part-1-3-by-indian-mom) by @indian-mom\n\nToday's guild nomination is a tale of a \"Good Son\" who helped his @indian-mom get her post noticed and voted for on the Steemvoter Guilds, a teen with only 22 SP in his Steem wallet managed to use what he had to get bot support and networked with others to help his mom's post get voted for the win.

Please only submit posts that are still within their 7 day voting window, and allow enough time for the guild vote to be done before their payout window closes. \n\n+ This is not about curation rewards for the guild members and getting in early on the vote etc, it is purely to reward the deserving author.\n\n+ @steemvoter will consider this a free market experiment and we will facilitate the voting of the post that the community wants voted, without checking for PLG of content, photos and artwork. At our discretion, blatantly inappropriate posts will not be voted on however.\n\n+ This is a beta guild project and terms are subject to change at any time. \n\n# Let's make Steem great ... together!!\n\n <hr>\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexGbcEFRk2RsNjb3g8x3xWFYZuXmNptdAFgEDpThsYGi/image.png)</center>\n\n\n# The Steemvoter Guild\n\nIf you are not already a part of our **[SV Guild](http://www.steemit.com/@steemvoter)** please support our service and the authors we uplift by signing up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/); add your Steem account and make sure the **\"Guild\"** checkbox is enabled for each account you load on the dashboard. \n\nIn addition, you will be able to use our bot service to select your own authors to auto-vote; the guild vote is an additional daily donation to a deserving Steem author. \n\nSteemvoter is a public curation bot with an easy to use interface, it truly is a bot for the people, making automatic curation on Steemit easy with just a few clicks.\n\nThis is a payment post!

With that in mind, we had planned to run out to Roscoe's after the shoot to grab some quick candid, improv photo's before we left. Both Kendrick and Roscoe's are both legendary and staples of the Los Angeles culture so it only made sense.\n\nWe were outside with a large group of us when people started to take notice of what was going on. Once that caused attention, the cops came by. With only a few minutes to get these shots and move on, I was able to capture some real, raw, candid shots that have been some of the most iconic photo's I think I've taken to date.\n\nThe greatest thing about this photoshoot to me is the location, how raw and real it is, not having anything planned and just capturing the real Los Angeles vibes. The cop coming by unplanned is just icing on the cake — which really makes this that much more real in the era we live in.\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT6Yp4UgQheEcoDyayX9sUuYxP1TyaAbuP2iVyhZ6GiGm/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-3.jpg)\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSQqvo1oCCEUmhJg7KGpWBoNjWW9Q14NGunYgMYJNCZRe/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-2.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"life\",\"blog\",\"music\",\"losangeles\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmbQgk4WYb7bAd88xqLrphDoxVuCPrMVjLXyfUG3jmZ9ZY\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoes.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmT6Yp4UgQheEcoDyayX9sUuYxP1TyaAbuP2iVyhZ6GiGm\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSQqvo1oCCEUmhJg7KGpWBoNjWW9Q14NGunYgMYJNCZRe\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-2.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":670,"numPages":75,"currentPage":68}}}
