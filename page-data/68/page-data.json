This would completely wipe out the need for polluting fossil fuels and revolutionise how we think about and use energy.  One company from the UK is trying to do just that—with the help of a special type of flooring.</p>\n\n<h2>Pavegen’s V3 Flooring</h2>\n\n<p>UK company Pavegen, has developed a special floor tile which generates electricity whenever someone walks over it. As people step on the tiles, their weight pushes down on electromagnetic induction generators causing them to move. The kinetic energy is then transferred into off-grid electricity which is stored in batteries.</p>\n\n<center><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sby4GR0sD8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></center>\n\n<h2>The idea</h2>\n\n<p>Laurence Kemball-Cook, the founder of Pavegen, came up with the idea after doing a placement year at the energy company Eon. He was given the task of finding a way to power street lighting with solar energy and wind. But due to constraints such as a lack of sunlight and temperamental weather, he couldn’t find a solution. Instead, he started thinking about other potential sources of power in urban environments. It was here that the idea for an energy harnessing floor was born.</p>\n\n<p>Given its usability, you’d think companies would have jumped at the chance to install this smart floor. However, after developing the technology it took Kemball-Cook several years to convince people to take it on. Speaking to The Guardian on how he got his first deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup\">he said</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Investors wouldn’t invest without tiles in the ground, so I broke into a building site on the south bank of the Thames at 2am, installed the product illegally, took photos and put them on our website saying: ‘Celebrating our latest installation.’ I closed a deal with Westfield pretty soon after that.</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Projects around the world</h2>\n\n<p>Since then, Pavegen has completed over 150 projects around the world, across various sectors including train stations, shopping centres, airports and public spaces. It’s also worked with brands like Coca-Cola and Siemens.</p>\n\n<p>It’s most recent installations were in West End London and in Heathrow Airport.</p>\n\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GSoTEhk.jpg\"/></p></center>\n\n<blockquote>Our Head of Comms (at)alexmwjohnson filming with (at)fastcompany today at our latest install in the heart of London's West End! Discussing how we are creating a smart, sustainable oasis just off one of the busiest areas in the city 🇬🇧 The project is launching soon - watch this space!</blockquote>\n\n<p>Photo: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BVZxp0-l0_t/\">Instagram</a></p>\n\n<center><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oimvzTj.jpg\"/></p></center>\n\n<blockquote>As people jet off on their holidays, they also contribute to powering the lights at @heathrow_airport through their footsteps👣 ✈️ Look out for us in Terminal 3!</blockquote>\n\n<p>Photo: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BT6eAnLFKWc/\">Instagram</a></p>\n\n<h2>Data collection</h2>\n\n<p>As well as producing electricity, the floor tiles also collect data. This data can then be used to measure footfall, predict peak timings and prime locations, ideal information for surrounding businesses like shops, cafes and restaurants. Likewise, anyone who steps on the tiles who is connected via a mobile APP collects points. Each footstep collected is converted into a digital currency that can be used to reward loyalty or to donate to charitable causes.</p>\n\n<p>Pavegen’s smart flooring appears a fantastic invention which has got people excited about alternative sources of energy. It’s not only encouraging people to walk in cities, rather than drive or take the bus, but also to think about energy consumption and how we can reduce our impact on the environment. Better for our health, better for the planet.</p>\n\n<p><em>Featured image: Pavegen/<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pavegen/\">Facebook</a></em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center><p><a href=\"https://www.adaptnetwork.com/\">adaptnetwork.com</a> | Inspiring life's adventure</p></center>\n\n</html>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"science\",\"technology\",\"life\",\"environment\"],\"users\":[\"heathrow\"],\"image\":[\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/zT9YvOL.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/_sby4GR0sD8\\/0.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/GSoTEhk.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/oimvzTj.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/embed\\/_sby4GR0sD8\",\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/technology\\/2015\\/jan\\/11\\/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup\",\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/p\\/BVZxp0-l0_t\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/p\\/BT6eAnLFKWc\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/pavegen\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.adaptnetwork.com\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"html\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"6a054e0e-5990-56c8-aadd-4765ac77da77","title":"Steemvoter Guild: \"Nominate-a-Friend\" for the Guild Vote (Thursday July 6)","author":"steemvoter","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"4cteeo-steemvoter-guild-nominate-a-friend-for-the-guild-vote-tuesday-july-4","body":"<center>https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/06/09/10/00/smartphone-1445489_960_720.jpg</center>\n\n## Previous first place winner - [Struggles of An Indian Girl | Before Birth To After School | Personal Experience | Part 1 - 3 by @indian-mom](https://steemit.com/life/@indian-mom/struggles-of-an-indian-girl-or-before-birth-to-after-school-or-personal-experience-or-part-1-3-by-indian-mom) by @indian-mom\n\nToday's guild nomination is a tale of a \"Good Son\" who helped his @indian-mom get her post noticed and voted for on the Steemvoter Guilds, a teen with only 22 SP in his Steem wallet managed to use what he had to get bot support and networked with others to help his mom's post get voted for the win.

Please only submit posts that are still within their 7 day voting window, and allow enough time for the guild vote to be done before their payout window closes. \n\n+ This is not about curation rewards for the guild members and getting in early on the vote etc, it is purely to reward the deserving author.\n\n+ @steemvoter will consider this a free market experiment and we will facilitate the voting of the post that the community wants voted, without checking for PLG of content, photos and artwork. At our discretion, blatantly inappropriate posts will not be voted on however.\n\n+ This is a beta guild project and terms are subject to change at any time. \n\n# Let's make Steem great ... together!!\n\n <hr>\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexGbcEFRk2RsNjb3g8x3xWFYZuXmNptdAFgEDpThsYGi/image.png)</center>\n\n\n# The Steemvoter Guild\n\nIf you are not already a part of our **[SV Guild](http://www.steemit.com/@steemvoter)** please support our service and the authors we uplift by signing up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/); add your Steem account and make sure the **\"Guild\"** checkbox is enabled for each account you load on the dashboard. \n\nIn addition, you will be able to use our bot service to select your own authors to auto-vote; the guild vote is an additional daily donation to a deserving Steem author. \n\nSteemvoter is a public curation bot with an easy to use interface, it truly is a bot for the people, making automatic curation on Steemit easy with just a few clicks.\n\nThis is a payment post!

With that in mind, we had planned to run out to Roscoe's after the shoot to grab some quick candid, improv photo's before we left. Both Kendrick and Roscoe's are both legendary and staples of the Los Angeles culture so it only made sense.\n\nWe were outside with a large group of us when people started to take notice of what was going on. Once that caused attention, the cops came by. With only a few minutes to get these shots and move on, I was able to capture some real, raw, candid shots that have been some of the most iconic photo's I think I've taken to date.\n\nThe greatest thing about this photoshoot to me is the location, how raw and real it is, not having anything planned and just capturing the real Los Angeles vibes. The cop coming by unplanned is just icing on the cake — which really makes this that much more real in the era we live in.\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT6Yp4UgQheEcoDyayX9sUuYxP1TyaAbuP2iVyhZ6GiGm/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-3.jpg)\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSQqvo1oCCEUmhJg7KGpWBoNjWW9Q14NGunYgMYJNCZRe/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-2.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"life\",\"blog\",\"music\",\"losangeles\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmbQgk4WYb7bAd88xqLrphDoxVuCPrMVjLXyfUG3jmZ9ZY\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoes.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmT6Yp4UgQheEcoDyayX9sUuYxP1TyaAbuP2iVyhZ6GiGm\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSQqvo1oCCEUmhJg7KGpWBoNjWW9Q14NGunYgMYJNCZRe\\/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-2.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e8ec36fb-ea8d-51e5-aff2-432e74b7397c","title":"Beautiful India #7 - Udaipur City Palace, Rajasthan","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 06, 2017","permlink":"beautiful-india-7-udaipur-city-palace-rajasthan","body":"I will be adding a lot of Images of Beautiful Indian Places.

I am really appreciate it.As I discovered my interest in photography and have devoted my love to nature, my friend recommended a place in Yuen Long to me. Today, I am taking you to there, Yuen Long Park. In order to present the beauty of the natural forest land in front of the visitors, landform and most of the trees are preserved. \n\n>  Steemit的朋友大家好，首先我想謝謝我的支持者，你們的心意我收到了，謝謝你們的留言和upvote，我會繼續努力寫更多好文給大家！元朗公園是我今天跟你分享的地方。最近我開始學習拍照，同時我也很喜歡大自然，我的朋友推薦了元朗公園這個拍照好地點給我。這個依山而建的公園，建園前是一個天然林地，為了呈現林地最原始美麗一面給遊客，大部份的樹木和原來地形都保存下來。\n\n<hr>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n*Here's the map of the Park, there are many facilities including gateball court, soccer pitch, artificial lake etc..*\n>*這裡是公園的地圖，園內有很多設施，包括足球場，草地門球場，人造湖等。*\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (12).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUmuysA71dWdv74fU8F9JdRyHkPegVwTgF2EZ7P8bnKB4/webwxgetmsgimg%20(12).jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\nBut the most eye-catching Chinese architectural building is a Aviary Pagoda located on the top of a hill. It makes me think of the Sakyamuni Pagoda of Fogong Temple in Shanxi, China that the architectural designs are very similar. It serves as an aviary at its lowest level and a viewing deck in its upper level. \n\n> 但最吸睛的是園內心臟地帶，具有中國建築特色的百鳥塔，這個塔讓我想起山西的應縣木塔，他們的建築設計非常相似。百鳥塔的最低層是鳥舍，上層則是觀景台。\n\n\n*Here's how it looks from outside.*\n>*我們來看看這個百鳥塔，是不是很有中國建築特色？*\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (10).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVyDxoDoXbfSs7c4RrEe5hMqzdj8cS48Czm4Z4A5AJ5gw/webwxgetmsgimg%20(10).jpeg)\n\n<br>\n\nThe lower level is an Aviary that over 100 different species of birds live in.\n\n> 低層是鳥舍，多達百多隻不同種類的鳥類居住在這𥚃。\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (17).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbdTgiejZGccdtDUK4PQddhbn575K5ZAyLsK9tywGgpTw/webwxgetmsgimg%20(17).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (18).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmboHxAoDUgPGovFzq7kGF37pMMrW5ePCJTonxzD1Ng3v6/webwxgetmsgimg%20(18).jpeg)\n\nA hill myna (also known as Gracula religiosa) greets the visitor by saying \"get away\" and \" what's wrong with you\" in Cantonese LOL. I was quite surprised when she say hello to me. Hill myna is a animal that good at learning human voice and reproduce it accurately and clearly. \n\n> 最讓我驚喜的是這隻小鷯哥，當日他跟我說了 “行開啦！（走開！）”跟 “做乜野呀你？（幹嘛啊你？）”，看來它不太歡迎我喔！鷯哥(學名：Gracula religiosa)是一種善於學習人類語言的鳥類，可準確清晰地摸仿不同的音調。\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Trf8oRo94Wc\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (26).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQgHQZw5ZpjqGcmEkp76JZuXVjXddDkqEWCJAQMKhsJcU/webwxgetmsgimg%20(26).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (19).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRuP1gis6ZSzc13f8htape4seCvchCtcc9WDDtWo26PpN/webwxgetmsgimg%20(19).jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\nWalking to the upper level, I found the place that my friend recommended to me. This photo is a bottom-up view of the stairs. I love the white and blue combination of these stairs and contrast of the light and shadow. \n\n>走到上層，我找到了我朋友向我推薦的地方。 這張照片是我由下往上拍的，是不是很棒呢？ 我喜歡這個由白色和藍色組合的樓梯，感覺很清新，和樓梯底的陰影形成強烈的對比。\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (5).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUxznmy3ZaEZa5j9tK22dYoz9uwrmGu3uJk4VJognQfLg/webwxgetmsgimg%20(5).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (6).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWyp8yrGVnH5QaFhkUPBZc1NrVHcC1LcNfGMyTMmjXCes/webwxgetmsgimg%20(6).jpeg)\n\nThe upper level is a viewing deck that offer a panoramic view of  Yuen Long. Although the weather is not good today, but I am enjoy my visit. \n\n>再往上走，我們就到了觀景台，這𥚃可以俯瞰整個公園和元朗。雖然今天的天氣不是很好，不過我還是很享受今天的行程。\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (15).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZcwE6sd3Skb4CPyq1DqH2DYmuWJP8Y74RdYDHe2HgPBa/webwxgetmsgimg%20(15).jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\nHere's other part of the park\n>這些是公園的其他設施，公園內種植了800棵不同的花木，也有小橋流水，是不是很不錯，大家喜歡我拍的照片嗎？\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (4).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYRxpnNQ337SdR8LJCyb7vL6GTPho6oFpnBsQ5EMaHbtu/webwxgetmsgimg%20(4).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (3).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGwRALxPdSqzzbMJ1jM7JpWzB52dQo6jdBfk6TDyUg67/webwxgetmsgimg%20(3).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (2).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYmVWnNGmbY4nihrJTiTQkf248q2DXT5RdfrA2nwNcqYd/webwxgetmsgimg%20(2).jpeg)\n\n![webwxgetmsgimg (1).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbLF1nRBiugFsm9XbEDGcxohKFrn7QfjuWyCumRepTxVg/webwxgetmsgimg%20(1).jpeg)\n\nI think I will stop here.
