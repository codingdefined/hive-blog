This world is too big to be explored. Everyone leaves at some point in life and as we grow up we realize how to be strong, alone!\n\nInvest time in things which make you better, especially the ones making their careers at this point of time. If it doesn't make you better or doesn't make you money leave it! Let it go!\n\nFollow 5 by 5 rule- If it won't matter in 5 years, don't waste more than 5 minutes for it.\n\nAt the end, it's you all alone!
