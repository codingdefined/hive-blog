At first we will connect to the Discord Server after passing the Discord Bot Token. \n\nOnce connected we will wait for the commands till we receive the $upvote command. Once we receive the $upvote command with the Steem URL we will get the author and the permalink of the the post to upvote. \n\nAfter that using the the function `steem.broadcast.voteAsync()` we will vote on that particular post. One think to note here that we can add how much percentage of upvote we are gonna use.\n\nSo for example when we try to upvote a url with 15% we will write like below\n\n`$upvote Steem_url 15`\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511541932/x5b9jblpwpouj4bqkpti.png)\n\n### Things Pending to be implemented\n\n1. Error Handling\n2. Upvote only post which is 12 hours before the payout\n\nSuggestions for the Bot are always welcome.\n\nGithub Repo : https://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordUpvoteBot\nCommit : https://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordUpvoteBot/commit/25bd5a2c3d7289cafaf13fa9edf19f8e9075533c\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/a-simple-manual-discord-upvote-bot\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 24, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Simple Manual Discord Upvote Bot","permlink":"a-simple-manual-discord-upvote-bot","previous":{"title":"Showing Will Release Payout even after Actual Payout in Utopian.io","permlink":"showing-will-release-payout-even-after-actual-payout-in-utopian-io"},"next":{"title":"Read Encrypted Memo using Steem.js","permlink":"read-encrypted-memo-using-steem-js"}}}}
