Before you judge me, I must say that I am healthy but to keep me in shape I do sometimes go to Morning Walk. After tiring 5 days in the week, people like me (lazy) just want to sleep on Saturday and Sunday. But today was different, I had made up my mind that I will go for a morning walk today atleast.\n\nYou know what I like about Morning, that it is so refreshing and you feel that something will good happen today as everyday is a new beginning for me at-least. So coming back to the morning walk I have started from home around 5:30 AM (was dark as hell as well as cold) but I was determined. It was a 10 minutes walk to the nearest Park which is like 10 sq.km huge.\n\nPeople come here around 4:30 AM, I always wonder whats-up with these people either they have whole day to sleep or they are very cautious about their health, either way it was none of my business. \n\nSince it was after some day I only kept walking and not running which I usually do. The below image is one of the section of the park where people walk bare foot and it is called Acupressure Section, it does its job very well.\n\n![IMG_20171230_063745.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXLyPJFAnrSzez9L1JvMR3cNsXsvccrJBewxF27TYwbmc/IMG_20171230_063745.jpg)\n\nPeople like me who wants to be healthy are coming to the park\n\n![IMG_20171230_064212.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPofqjSai6tGm3uaSQJKJMmjwZ4emmoJiDJseF8MkGsCV/IMG_20171230_064212.jpg)\n\nI must say I did not have any intention to take great picture, it just happened. A nice little pond with trees all around which enhances its view to the core.\n\n![IMG_20171230_064338.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRhnEZ7bWH2YUR8nxUSjGp8FEG7po7g8Yn8T5ebwAqqN8/IMG_20171230_064338.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20171230_064349.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZvhZiiu9uakFfDHCtXKhjsMscvZm8d19DsPQVUNVw5C7/IMG_20171230_064349.jpg)\n\nAt the end, I did finished the Goal which is of 6000 steps and I walked 6250 steps in an hour.\n\n![Screenshot_20171230-185127.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbBJcoWdu5XpWs4VP8as7Ng61hukanGYDGqRNLm8guWM6/Screenshot_20171230-185127.png)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","created":"December 30, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Lets Take a Morning Walk with me","permlink":"lets-take-a-morning-walk-with-me","previous":{"title":"Get All the Online Members of Discord using Discordie","permlink":"get-all-the-online-members-of-discord-using-discordie"},"next":{"title":"Sunset on the New Year Eve","permlink":"sunset-on-the-new-year-eve"}}}}
