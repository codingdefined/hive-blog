I will try to write whenever I will learn any new things or discover anything which will make my life easier. \n\nI am working on SOLR (Solr is an open source search platform, written in Java) for quite some time and I have not fully discovered the software as a whole. I learn new things everyday whenever I start working on it. One such thing I learned today is analyzing my result. \n\nBefore today, whenever I change my schema I reindex all my documents to see if the change worked or not. But doing that was time-consuming as I have to reindex the whole database which would take almost half a day depending on the network. \n\nNow with Analysis I actually do not have to reindex the whole database, but I can analyze the field by sending the query to know if that is giving me right results or not as shown below.\n\n<center>![solr.PNG](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeMqKJsPVJ3tRYhNR6rujEiFGYyKxarfQGSHFSG49tcfk)</center>\n\n\nIn simple terms, Analysis helps me to inspect how the data will be handled according to the field, field type based on the Schema. Now I can analyze how content would be handled during indexing as well as query processing and view the results at the same time, thus it helps me to be productive.\n\n#### Is there anything new you have learned today?","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"learning\",\"blog\",\"india\",\"busy\",\"steemdev\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmeMqKJsPVJ3tRYhNR6rujEiFGYyKxarfQGSHFSG49tcfk\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"1ed65d40-287c-5d4a-aa6e-dd8ff50d7965","title":"What I do when I feel being a developer is boring","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 03, 2018","permlink":"what-i-do-when-i-feel-being-a-developer-is-boring","body":"As a developer, I sometimes feel bored when I have to do the same task again and again in my day job, so I have to do something other than the normal coding which helps me to overcome the boredom.\n\nFirst and foremost reason of getting bored is that you are not liking what you are doing. That's true when we have to do the same task again and again, it feels boring. But being in a day job you do not have any other option but have to do the task, so how you will overcome that boredom.\n\nThe reason is simple, try different things. I usually work on ASP.NET and I love it but I always have to manage the legacy code and I could not learn any new technologies coming in my way. So what I have done I started my mini project (though not getting enough time now to work on that) which is on the newer technologies which have its own set of issues and excitement. Thus I can somehow reduce the boredom because now I can spend some hours on the exciting things. \n\nSimilarly, you should also start with some hobby along with Software Development, like playing guitar, traveling or even photography. I too whenever possible try to travel as well as clicking pictures which reduces my boredom quite a lot.

So yesterday I tried to learn Long Exposure Photography using Smartphone. \n\nSince I have a Nokia 6, I do not have an option of changing ISO or Shutter Speed. Because of that I have downloaded Open Camera which has lot of option in Manual Settings which can be changed to get the photo in wherever way you want.\n\nSo since I have to do Long Exposure, I only have to change the ISO and Shutter Speed, which can be changed as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/3tcfo2wjsk.jpg)\n\nSince I was novice in Stutter Speed, I have not changed the settings. So I have clicked with ISO 50 and no change in Stutter Speed. There is no difference in image as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/bjmpf8n5xp.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, there is very less light and only tail lights of few cars can be seen and the whole background is black.\n\nThen I tried to change the Stutter Speed and made it as half. Though I got some photos but they were also not that great as shown below. Even though, it was not great I learned that along with ISO you also need to change the Shutter Speed. \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/wcw9iq0925.jpg)\n\nAs I have learned I changed the ISO to 50 and Sutter Speed to 1/12 s, I started getting some of the good photos as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/s5kdnbnvsb.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/kxua0uepnh.jpg)\n\n   ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/wif02evj4n.jpg)\n\nThen I edited the first best picture using snapseed and got my first learning successful.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/zenhv2nrze.jpg)\n\nThough I have to learn a lot, but it was a successful experiment or learning.\n\nCamera : Nokia 6, Open Camera","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/3tcfo2wjsk.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/bjmpf8n5xp.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/wcw9iq0925.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/s5kdnbnvsb.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/kxua0uepnh.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/wif02evj4n.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/zenhv2nrze.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"longexposurephotography\",\"photofeed\",\"india\",\"photography\",\"photocircle\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"923eb868-8ab9-5b16-8c92-9cc494de25e6","title":"What photos look like Painting","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 30, 2018","permlink":"what-photos-look-like-painting","body":"In your opinion what photos look like its painted and not really taken.
