I am actually controlling my food habit to kind of restrict myself within 1600 calories, but I could not hold myself back to go to Taco Bell for a monthly cheat day.\n\nI love Burrito and Taco and I can eat them anytime. So it was a dinner time when I went and have veg Burrito, Corn Salad and Veg Taco.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/p0kowhor2k.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/c7ukjlvjr7.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/105xgyphzo.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/vo5lbawjbq.jpg)\n\nThe Taco and Burrito fillings were paneer though Taco Bell has three flavours, but I like paneer much more than others.
