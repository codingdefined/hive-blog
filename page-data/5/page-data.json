By this post, I would like to review my past year and see how I can improve in the coming year. \n\nIf I compare my [last year Review](https://staging.busy.org/@codingdefined/2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer), I have not contributed much on the open-source world but the numbers are not that bad either. 140contributions is to some extent is ok, but I would like to do much more. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNZpm5WwyPz6joRRnhgj73GFtpL7zPm2aaHiXf2NYTXGM)\n\nThe biggest thing I have completed in 2019 is to learn Angular 6 and also I have completely migrated my project (LetsDisc) from ASP.NET MVC to Angular 6 frontend. Along with that I am also learning advanced JavaScript and will continue to do that. \n\n[LetsDisc](https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc) is a StackOverflow on Steem Blockchain, where you can add your programming questions, though I will continue to work on it and by mid-2020 thinking of releasing the Alpha version of it. That's one of my goals for 2020.\n\nProfessionally I have taken a new job this December and because of that I am less active here as well as in Github and I think it will continue like this for another month or so. I am just getting comfortable in the new job and since it is a little far from where I stay, a lot of time has been getting wasted in the commute.\n\nI also started taking my Photography skills little seriously, bought a new Canon Lens and will continue to explore more on photography, and I must tell you should keep a hobby alongside your day job it does wonders when you are in stress at least it does for me.\n\nOn the blogging side, I have posted around 48 posts last year on my blog https://www.codingdefined.com, i.e. only 4 posts per month. In 2020, hopefully, I will post more and would like to touch at least 8-9 posts per month.\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"opensource\",\"developer\",\"neoxian\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"palnet\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/staging.busy.org\\/@codingdefined\\/2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\\/LetsDisc\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNZpm5WwyPz6joRRnhgj73GFtpL7zPm2aaHiXf2NYTXGM\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"db194522-12da-5465-ab7d-5cf1caf096be","title":"Why I started using StepSetGo","author":"codingdefined","created":"December 27, 2019","permlink":"why-i-started-using-stepsetgo","body":"Rewarding excercise is not common now a days, there are a lot of apps or dapps which reward you for your daily activity. Our own Actifit is one such example, the only reason of not using it that I have to write my daily activities which looks repetitive for me.\n\nSimilarly I came across an app called StepSetGo which is again rewards users based on their activity. It takes your step from Google Fit app, though you don't have to install it for using StepSetGo.\n\n![8ls3s1upjm.png](https://img.esteem.ws/8ls3s1upjm.png)\n\nThe concept of rewarding is different. You need to maintain your level for 3 days otherwise you will be downgraded, if you achieve the highest coins of your level for 3 days you will be upgraded. There are mainly 5 levels as shown below:\n\nIn the first level you can get up to 5 coins and this is one of the easiest level. If you are walking outside you get 1.25 coins for every 1000 steps whereas if you are walking basic steps you get 1 coins for every 1000 steps. Now for getting 5 coins you need maximum 5000 steps. When you get 5 coins for 3 days you will be upgraded to level 2.\n\n![u9paljbtdu.png](https://img.esteem.ws/u9paljbtdu.png)\n\nIn level 2 you need to get 5 coins to stay in level 2 every 3 days. If you do not get 5 coins consecutive for 3 days you will get downgraded to level 1. In the level 2, you need to get 10 coins for 3 days to get upgraded to level 3.\n\n![bnlrfqlgft.png](https://img.esteem.ws/bnlrfqlgft.png)\n\nIn level 3 the safe zone is 10 coins whereas the maximum you can get is 15 coins.\n\n![jhmaklky3m.png](https://img.esteem.ws/jhmaklky3m.png)\n\nIn level 4, the safe zone is 15 coins whereas the maximum is 20 coins.\n\n![5j6iwsnnxn.png](https://img.esteem.ws/5j6iwsnnxn.png)\n\nI think level 5 is the most toughest zone because you need to get 25 coins to be safe whereas maximum you can take is 30 coins.\n\n![ssu1n1oqej.png](https://img.esteem.ws/ssu1n1oqej.png)\n\nI think Level 5 is the toughest level because getting 25 coins means you need to walk atleast 20K steps. I am at level 4 and trying to be in level 4 itself for sometime before moving to level 5.\n\n![juu3vja5vt.png](https://img.esteem.ws/juu3vja5vt.png)\n\nYou can also see how much you have walked till now and the coin balance.\n\n![tmp9r1e77p.png](https://img.esteem.ws/tmp9r1e77p.png)\n\nNow when you have accumulated coins you can buy or get discounts based on your purchase in Bazzar or market. When you get 15000 coins you can redeem IPhone X from that coin isn't it cool.\n\nWhy I really like this app is not about the coins mainly but because you can actually compete with your friends to see who can walk more in a week thus a sense of competition also helps the cause of keeping users motivated. Also there are ways to get more coins when you are on a higher level thus you tend to walk the minimum steps in 3 days just to keep yourself on that level.\n\nHave you used StepSetGo, how was your experience?","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/8ls3s1upjm.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/u9paljbtdu.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/bnlrfqlgft.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/jhmaklky3m.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/5j6iwsnnxn.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/ssu1n1oqej.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/juu3vja5vt.png\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/tmp9r1e77p.png\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"dblog\",\"realityhubs\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"142ac59a-f625-525d-a484-9eb604393365","title":"A Red Flower Amidst Greenery","author":"codingdefined","created":"December 04, 2019","permlink":"a-red-flower-amidst-greenery","body":"The image was taken while my trekking to Ramanagara. \n\n>Ramanagara is a city as well as a district located in Karnataka which is around 50 km from Bangalore.

It is also famous because the iconic Bollywood movie Sholay was shot here. Thus Ramagiri hill is also known as Sholay Hills. \n\nWe went trekking to Ramadevra Betta mountain which is famous for its rocky mountain. We have started our journey around 7:00 AM from Bangalore since it was around 50 Km we have taken our motorbike instead of taking a cab. We have reached Bidadi at 7:45 AM and had our breakfast and started from there around 8:15 AM. Bidadi which is an industrial suburb of Bangalore is associated with bisi thatte idli. Thatte means plate in Kannada and this idli got its name because of its shape as it resembles plate or disc. We got complimentary Vada with Sambhar and Chutney. The price was Rs 50 / $0.8 per plate and it was worth it.\n\n![IMG-20191202-WA0008.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbEg56LkcKbaMvZ8aG8jWYcQroJq7F7xDdTMcHMD3EzpP)\n\nAt around 8:50 AM we reached Ramanagara, the entrance of the road to Ramadevra Betta is located beside a Huge Hanuman statue. From the statue, it was around 2-3 km ride. The gate opens only at 9:00 AM.  The entry fee is Rs 25 / $0.35 per person and Rs 10/ $0.15 for two-wheeler parking.\n\nIt is also known as Vulture Sanctuary but we could not find any. They have ample parking facilities for both four-wheeler and two-wheeler. You will find an entrance that leads to the Rama temple. The climb to the temple is around 400 steps and the steps are easy to climb. \n\n#### Entrance\n\n![IMG_2017.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSrF7hhyaBLS9zevkDfvVPs9KwGwpNx8GvtGG429irC9a)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Hanuman Idol at the Entrance\n\n![IMG_2019.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbWUHdf6JfpF8iZmXVNtQV3wFKByKYgsCsxeFA27bdx9A)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Corridor\n\n![IMG_2018.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQqeeAHWBCFvciZ5jvbdEfzeXUhfGP3R1xy1iZwSXoxtm)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### More Steps\n\n![IMG_2021.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSq8ckDQgacCEJdzD34yMKFZWnjhzWZP7emt3euAxkZuA)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Rocky Visuals\n\n![IMG_2024.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmavrQNZcrZfS3z6MapEm47J9HdJvS3DvBsnaCJEDa1hY3)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Small Caves Spotted\n\n![IMG_2028.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQox6XFQnvHUmSFXZf3GDZgwsxwMU2HY7uzDCPQSHe49t)\n\n![IMG_2029.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmczKynfuZSsqxD2cZGKNt1pb4J7x3GwEpenQbugWb47Wk)\n\n<hr>\n\nAfter climbing 400 steps you will reach to the foothills of the temple. Actually, there is two temples one of Shiva and the other of Ram & Sita.\n\n#### Siva Temple\n\n![IMG_2041.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSfhRqhXRkPpMhHeRwk25YMxXk9DwNEZ4hMTTjkV7Kxpk)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Ram & Sita Temple\n\n![IMG_2046.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdgzPzuv7tCsJipUzCdFogv7ydQWA1gvMwUPrdeAnZDm5)\n\n<hr>\n\nFrom the temple you need to climb further which is a pure rocky terrain. The path is extreme left of the temple. Some visuals as you climb :\n\n![IMG_2049.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbKzey6qxHmwJ3BAQo9VyNFAUUWSd1odsJYdSFutBHxnn)\n\n![IMG_2050.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTtFR7ReLAw6pMydfSqbNvSjkRTHJkZEop5TNZRqxf5DB)\n\n![IMG_2056.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRgRJTWyMUSKu39hLBbQ2876guGfvVk1BmFES12GVJ1Vk)\n\n![IMG_2058.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRh2HZg1TZcbVE4wDgmLdUm8XozbdNVwrJWmh2c2CTSQ1)\n\n![IMG_2061.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNdKCaxHVZeBX4mXBBPE2E6ASY6ztBpEH5GjP8xmMV5Ym)\n\n![IMG_2057.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR46b8NirK2H3L3RLcJNYuddpdJ8ZN4UVvQo8F3AyCftc)\n\n<hr>\n\nThe last part of the trek is what the scariest part if you have not climbed the rocky mountain before, though anyone can climb it easily. After you climb it, you will love the stunning view from the top. The view provides a panoramic view of the town, the rocky mountain ranges and the forest at the foothills of the mountain.\n\n#### The actual trekking\n\n![IMG_2078.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWYn9DMqwXevZ3sfcuqADnt8fGndDQh6z9my1WWq5fnwi)\n\n#### Stunning View from the Top\n\n![IMG_2079.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZ5XwDYLfiBCFnnoupT7KPgqJTrJAQK7jafmF3NZ8Zg13)\n\n![IMG_2081.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNbgWEtv1uBrqac9KPaSFKC6NaxzXpSbQ6gQaCTv7Ekuk)\n\n![IMG_2083.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUdVHDk3MsWPvtJWw5Tqaq4JzJHmV3T6xuw7QZtTcfMLV)\n\n![IMG_2089.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVJkEQHRzyyZ1xa1g3kE9DNG9rMwMXifwhu1pNySLN81H)\n\n![IMG_2090.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVBdNStmds8v5xP1kjYYtfp9Mc16TDgnxhiD4YgBsZNTJ)\n\n![IMG_2098.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWQDigVy4KQecNAv3REEsu1VyzrbEtGAypfZpPHD7fGCv)\n\nIt was an overall great trekking experience. Though I would not say that it was real trekking though you will get a feel of it. I would say anyone can do this trekking irrespective of your age, though you might end up taking more time than usual.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"travelfeed\",\"busy\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"creativecoin\",\"dblog\",\"zzan\",\"oc\",\"travelphotography\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbEg56LkcKbaMvZ8aG8jWYcQroJq7F7xDdTMcHMD3EzpP\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSrF7hhyaBLS9zevkDfvVPs9KwGwpNx8GvtGG429irC9a\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbWUHdf6JfpF8iZmXVNtQV3wFKByKYgsCsxeFA27bdx9A\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQqeeAHWBCFvciZ5jvbdEfzeXUhfGP3R1xy1iZwSXoxtm\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSq8ckDQgacCEJdzD34yMKFZWnjhzWZP7emt3euAxkZuA\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmavrQNZcrZfS3z6MapEm47J9HdJvS3DvBsnaCJEDa1hY3\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQox6XFQnvHUmSFXZf3GDZgwsxwMU2HY7uzDCPQSHe49t\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmczKynfuZSsqxD2cZGKNt1pb4J7x3GwEpenQbugWb47Wk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSfhRqhXRkPpMhHeRwk25YMxXk9DwNEZ4hMTTjkV7Kxpk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdgzPzuv7tCsJipUzCdFogv7ydQWA1gvMwUPrdeAnZDm5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbKzey6qxHmwJ3BAQo9VyNFAUUWSd1odsJYdSFutBHxnn\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTtFR7ReLAw6pMydfSqbNvSjkRTHJkZEop5TNZRqxf5DB\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRgRJTWyMUSKu39hLBbQ2876guGfvVk1BmFES12GVJ1Vk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRh2HZg1TZcbVE4wDgmLdUm8XozbdNVwrJWmh2c2CTSQ1\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNdKCaxHVZeBX4mXBBPE2E6ASY6ztBpEH5GjP8xmMV5Ym\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmR46b8NirK2H3L3RLcJNYuddpdJ8ZN4UVvQo8F3AyCftc\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWYn9DMqwXevZ3sfcuqADnt8fGndDQh6z9my1WWq5fnwi\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZ5XwDYLfiBCFnnoupT7KPgqJTrJAQK7jafmF3NZ8Zg13\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNbgWEtv1uBrqac9KPaSFKC6NaxzXpSbQ6gQaCTv7Ekuk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUdVHDk3MsWPvtJWw5Tqaq4JzJHmV3T6xuw7QZtTcfMLV\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVJkEQHRzyyZ1xa1g3kE9DNG9rMwMXifwhu1pNySLN81H\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVBdNStmds8v5xP1kjYYtfp9Mc16TDgnxhiD4YgBsZNTJ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWQDigVy4KQecNAv3REEsu1VyzrbEtGAypfZpPHD7fGCv\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"75d123f1-132c-523b-9a24-9c4bd78bab09","title":"Buying Stocks Made Easier - Groww","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 27, 2019","permlink":"buying-stocks-made-easier-groww","body":"Till now I was using Groww for buying mutual funds because it was Easy, Fast and Transparent and the main thing was Investing is FREE in Groww.

I had my birthday on 18th November, and my wife knew that I wanted to buy a fitness band for a long. So, without informing me she has bought Mi Band 4 and gifted me on my birthday, it was a surprise and I totally liked it. \n\nThere are a lot of features in the band as work out details, heart rate monitoring, weather and phone notifications, alarm, and music controls, etc directly from the band. To view the stats you need to download the Mi Fit app on your phone and you can customize your details accordingly. The text looks great and there is no issues in reading the text in bright sunlight. I started leaving my watch at home and using it for everything thus fewer pieces of equipment in hand to wear.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXJFfJB6sdCFTYWVA89rjbRWdCUJaea675TDbkHJTqYU2)\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTojgJj1ttM7SbuKJuZ8Jxt6VCMTyBUT9amDbmSUeRvYC)\n\nIt has a great design and the display looks dazzling. The Mi Band has comfortable straps and its easy to wear. You can actually wear it 24/7 without feeling a difference. It has a great battery like, where I have used it for a week and still the battery shows 79%, i.e. down by only 21%. One more thing I liked about the band is how accurate the count is. The walk tracking feature is fairly accurate and literally I have counted it and it does a great job in it. \n\n![_DSC0206.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUkCg9fEQjuZUxdBpckUBRYbyBMEQG2nTkp4Uy3WoAVcD)\n\nOne thing I don't like is that you need to remove the AMOLED display to charge it which eventually makes the band width increase which makes the display band prone to come out of the band.  The sleep tracking is fairly accurate too, yesterday I slept around 11:30 and woke up around 7, as you can see below.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbJWTat9MLmnrRUwxN97JVWz7wCJRxTGMsn6cFZgEznLH)\n\nThe price is on a higher side i.e. 40$, but overall its pocket-friendly. Overall it's a good band with a lot of features and if you love to track your activities it's a good buy and a good investment in yourself. It's also the best gift if you would like to give it to someone, people will really appreciate it.\n\n#### **The pros of the Band:**\n\n1. accuracy\n2. display\n3. waterproof\n4. good battery life\n5. pocket-friendly\n\nThe only con I can think of is how you charge the band and nothing else.

Taking the above example itself if you are writing about travel, that does not mean you cannot write about a natural calamity which was happened. Or if you are learning javascript which does not mean that you cannot learn SQL, even though you are focussing only on frontend technology. \n\nFocus does not mean that you cannot check out other things or you cannot work on other things. I am a .Net Developer but still i work on Node.js sometimes does not mean i am changing the focus from .Net but something is better in Node.js.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n\n","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"marlians\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.2-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d45029ab-5ef4-561c-bc0d-dbb1ac6d18cc","title":"When you can't see what's below you","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 08, 2019","permlink":"when-you-can-t-see-what-s-below-you","body":"This image is taken in Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India which is a hill station.

Though it was a cloudy day, we thought it would be great to see some of the mountains and get good landscape photos.
