It is also famous because the iconic Bollywood movie Sholay was shot here. Thus Ramagiri hill is also known as Sholay Hills. \n\nWe went trekking to Ramadevra Betta mountain which is famous for its rocky mountain. We have started our journey around 7:00 AM from Bangalore since it was around 50 Km we have taken our motorbike instead of taking a cab. We have reached Bidadi at 7:45 AM and had our breakfast and started from there around 8:15 AM. Bidadi which is an industrial suburb of Bangalore is associated with bisi thatte idli. Thatte means plate in Kannada and this idli got its name because of its shape as it resembles plate or disc. We got complimentary Vada with Sambhar and Chutney. The price was Rs 50 / $0.8 per plate and it was worth it.\n\n![IMG-20191202-WA0008.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbEg56LkcKbaMvZ8aG8jWYcQroJq7F7xDdTMcHMD3EzpP)\n\nAt around 8:50 AM we reached Ramanagara, the entrance of the road to Ramadevra Betta is located beside a Huge Hanuman statue. From the statue, it was around 2-3 km ride. The gate opens only at 9:00 AM.  The entry fee is Rs 25 / $0.35 per person and Rs 10/ $0.15 for two-wheeler parking.\n\nIt is also known as Vulture Sanctuary but we could not find any. They have ample parking facilities for both four-wheeler and two-wheeler. You will find an entrance that leads to the Rama temple. The climb to the temple is around 400 steps and the steps are easy to climb. \n\n#### Entrance\n\n![IMG_2017.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSrF7hhyaBLS9zevkDfvVPs9KwGwpNx8GvtGG429irC9a)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Hanuman Idol at the Entrance\n\n![IMG_2019.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbWUHdf6JfpF8iZmXVNtQV3wFKByKYgsCsxeFA27bdx9A)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Corridor\n\n![IMG_2018.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQqeeAHWBCFvciZ5jvbdEfzeXUhfGP3R1xy1iZwSXoxtm)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### More Steps\n\n![IMG_2021.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSq8ckDQgacCEJdzD34yMKFZWnjhzWZP7emt3euAxkZuA)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Rocky Visuals\n\n![IMG_2024.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmavrQNZcrZfS3z6MapEm47J9HdJvS3DvBsnaCJEDa1hY3)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Small Caves Spotted\n\n![IMG_2028.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQox6XFQnvHUmSFXZf3GDZgwsxwMU2HY7uzDCPQSHe49t)\n\n![IMG_2029.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmczKynfuZSsqxD2cZGKNt1pb4J7x3GwEpenQbugWb47Wk)\n\n<hr>\n\nAfter climbing 400 steps you will reach to the foothills of the temple. Actually, there is two temples one of Shiva and the other of Ram & Sita.\n\n#### Siva Temple\n\n![IMG_2041.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSfhRqhXRkPpMhHeRwk25YMxXk9DwNEZ4hMTTjkV7Kxpk)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Ram & Sita Temple\n\n![IMG_2046.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdgzPzuv7tCsJipUzCdFogv7ydQWA1gvMwUPrdeAnZDm5)\n\n<hr>\n\nFrom the temple you need to climb further which is a pure rocky terrain. The path is extreme left of the temple. Some visuals as you climb :\n\n![IMG_2049.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbKzey6qxHmwJ3BAQo9VyNFAUUWSd1odsJYdSFutBHxnn)\n\n![IMG_2050.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTtFR7ReLAw6pMydfSqbNvSjkRTHJkZEop5TNZRqxf5DB)\n\n![IMG_2056.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRgRJTWyMUSKu39hLBbQ2876guGfvVk1BmFES12GVJ1Vk)\n\n![IMG_2058.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRh2HZg1TZcbVE4wDgmLdUm8XozbdNVwrJWmh2c2CTSQ1)\n\n![IMG_2061.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNdKCaxHVZeBX4mXBBPE2E6ASY6ztBpEH5GjP8xmMV5Ym)\n\n![IMG_2057.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR46b8NirK2H3L3RLcJNYuddpdJ8ZN4UVvQo8F3AyCftc)\n\n<hr>\n\nThe last part of the trek is what the scariest part if you have not climbed the rocky mountain before, though anyone can climb it easily. After you climb it, you will love the stunning view from the top. The view provides a panoramic view of the town, the rocky mountain ranges and the forest at the foothills of the mountain.\n\n#### The actual trekking\n\n![IMG_2078.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWYn9DMqwXevZ3sfcuqADnt8fGndDQh6z9my1WWq5fnwi)\n\n#### Stunning View from the Top\n\n![IMG_2079.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZ5XwDYLfiBCFnnoupT7KPgqJTrJAQK7jafmF3NZ8Zg13)\n\n![IMG_2081.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNbgWEtv1uBrqac9KPaSFKC6NaxzXpSbQ6gQaCTv7Ekuk)\n\n![IMG_2083.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUdVHDk3MsWPvtJWw5Tqaq4JzJHmV3T6xuw7QZtTcfMLV)\n\n![IMG_2089.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVJkEQHRzyyZ1xa1g3kE9DNG9rMwMXifwhu1pNySLN81H)\n\n![IMG_2090.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVBdNStmds8v5xP1kjYYtfp9Mc16TDgnxhiD4YgBsZNTJ)\n\n![IMG_2098.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWQDigVy4KQecNAv3REEsu1VyzrbEtGAypfZpPHD7fGCv)\n\nIt was an overall great trekking experience. Though I would not say that it was real trekking though you will get a feel of it. I would say anyone can do this trekking irrespective of your age, though you might end up taking more time than usual.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"travelfeed\",\"busy\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"creativecoin\",\"dblog\",\"zzan\",\"oc\",\"travelphotography\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbEg56LkcKbaMvZ8aG8jWYcQroJq7F7xDdTMcHMD3EzpP\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSrF7hhyaBLS9zevkDfvVPs9KwGwpNx8GvtGG429irC9a\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbWUHdf6JfpF8iZmXVNtQV3wFKByKYgsCsxeFA27bdx9A\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQqeeAHWBCFvciZ5jvbdEfzeXUhfGP3R1xy1iZwSXoxtm\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSq8ckDQgacCEJdzD34yMKFZWnjhzWZP7emt3euAxkZuA\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmavrQNZcrZfS3z6MapEm47J9HdJvS3DvBsnaCJEDa1hY3\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQox6XFQnvHUmSFXZf3GDZgwsxwMU2HY7uzDCPQSHe49t\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmczKynfuZSsqxD2cZGKNt1pb4J7x3GwEpenQbugWb47Wk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSfhRqhXRkPpMhHeRwk25YMxXk9DwNEZ4hMTTjkV7Kxpk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdgzPzuv7tCsJipUzCdFogv7ydQWA1gvMwUPrdeAnZDm5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmbKzey6qxHmwJ3BAQo9VyNFAUUWSd1odsJYdSFutBHxnn\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTtFR7ReLAw6pMydfSqbNvSjkRTHJkZEop5TNZRqxf5DB\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRgRJTWyMUSKu39hLBbQ2876guGfvVk1BmFES12GVJ1Vk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRh2HZg1TZcbVE4wDgmLdUm8XozbdNVwrJWmh2c2CTSQ1\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNdKCaxHVZeBX4mXBBPE2E6ASY6ztBpEH5GjP8xmMV5Ym\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmR46b8NirK2H3L3RLcJNYuddpdJ8ZN4UVvQo8F3AyCftc\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWYn9DMqwXevZ3sfcuqADnt8fGndDQh6z9my1WWq5fnwi\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZ5XwDYLfiBCFnnoupT7KPgqJTrJAQK7jafmF3NZ8Zg13\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmNbgWEtv1uBrqac9KPaSFKC6NaxzXpSbQ6gQaCTv7Ekuk\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUdVHDk3MsWPvtJWw5Tqaq4JzJHmV3T6xuw7QZtTcfMLV\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVJkEQHRzyyZ1xa1g3kE9DNG9rMwMXifwhu1pNySLN81H\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVBdNStmds8v5xP1kjYYtfp9Mc16TDgnxhiD4YgBsZNTJ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWQDigVy4KQecNAv3REEsu1VyzrbEtGAypfZpPHD7fGCv\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"75d123f1-132c-523b-9a24-9c4bd78bab09","title":"Buying Stocks Made Easier - Groww","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 27, 2019","permlink":"buying-stocks-made-easier-groww","body":"Till now I was using Groww for buying mutual funds because it was Easy, Fast and Transparent and the main thing was Investing is FREE in Groww.

I had my birthday on 18th November, and my wife knew that I wanted to buy a fitness band for a long. So, without informing me she has bought Mi Band 4 and gifted me on my birthday, it was a surprise and I totally liked it. \n\nThere are a lot of features in the band as work out details, heart rate monitoring, weather and phone notifications, alarm, and music controls, etc directly from the band. To view the stats you need to download the Mi Fit app on your phone and you can customize your details accordingly. The text looks great and there is no issues in reading the text in bright sunlight. I started leaving my watch at home and using it for everything thus fewer pieces of equipment in hand to wear.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXJFfJB6sdCFTYWVA89rjbRWdCUJaea675TDbkHJTqYU2)\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTojgJj1ttM7SbuKJuZ8Jxt6VCMTyBUT9amDbmSUeRvYC)\n\nIt has a great design and the display looks dazzling. The Mi Band has comfortable straps and its easy to wear. You can actually wear it 24/7 without feeling a difference. It has a great battery like, where I have used it for a week and still the battery shows 79%, i.e. down by only 21%. One more thing I liked about the band is how accurate the count is. The walk tracking feature is fairly accurate and literally I have counted it and it does a great job in it. \n\n![_DSC0206.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUkCg9fEQjuZUxdBpckUBRYbyBMEQG2nTkp4Uy3WoAVcD)\n\nOne thing I don't like is that you need to remove the AMOLED display to charge it which eventually makes the band width increase which makes the display band prone to come out of the band.  The sleep tracking is fairly accurate too, yesterday I slept around 11:30 and woke up around 7, as you can see below.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbJWTat9MLmnrRUwxN97JVWz7wCJRxTGMsn6cFZgEznLH)\n\nThe price is on a higher side i.e. 40$, but overall its pocket-friendly. Overall it's a good band with a lot of features and if you love to track your activities it's a good buy and a good investment in yourself. It's also the best gift if you would like to give it to someone, people will really appreciate it.\n\n#### **The pros of the Band:**\n\n1. accuracy\n2. display\n3. waterproof\n4. good battery life\n5. pocket-friendly\n\nThe only con I can think of is how you charge the band and nothing else.

You should focus on one thing that is true but that does not mean you should ignore other things altogether. Taking the above example itself if you are writing about travel, that does not mean you cannot write about a natural calamity which was happened. Or if you are learning javascript which does not mean that you cannot learn SQL, even though you are focussing only on frontend technology. \n\nFocus does not mean that you cannot check out other things or you cannot work on other things.

When I checked my portfolio today, I am sitting on a profit which is around 10% in the last one year, which is not bad at all because I know even if it goes down I will always be in a profit since the risk is not too high.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmT1de2RYPoFU7JS2a1R5eiobPUXBCfWw7JQhzj7WrWvk5)\n\nAlso, the length of my portfolio is Ultra Short Duration which means it will always give me profit in a short duration no matter what, thus I will always have my money in hand if I need it. \n\nSo anyone investing in  this less risk portfolio for 5 years, with Rs. 20000, they will easily get more than 15.5 Lakhs.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTuhiVe88rBvX8qJF15LqwkuB3D8Qe6bMddPxbALZKfar)","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"steemleo\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYjHZEEas9Z2Cnk5m3cF9bYd7dyQt5mSrPsYCTm2mFAjW\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmT1de2RYPoFU7JS2a1R5eiobPUXBCfWw7JQhzj7WrWvk5\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTuhiVe88rBvX8qJF15LqwkuB3D8Qe6bMddPxbALZKfar\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"3877e17d-dcad-5f34-92b6-fa87c1ead87d","title":"A Simple bug turns out to be a Night Mare","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 22, 2019","permlink":"a-simple-bug-turns-out-to-be-a-night-mare","body":"How a simple bug in one of the open-source project which I was working on turns out to be a nightmare though not literally. It all started with me talking to the project owner to allow me to work on it. \n\nThe change was small, that is I have to check if the props are passing the read-only value or not and based on that I will show the toolbar. Sounds a simple right, I thought the same, thus written the code as \n\n`!props.readOnly && <MyComponent ..... />`\n\nWhat the above code will do it will check if the readOnly is true, it will not show the component if its false it will show the component. So far so good, I was able to fix it. Now the project owner wanted me to add a button on the parent component, which will toggle this behavior. That means based on button click I will show the toolbar or not.\n\nEasy-peasy, that's what I thought. So I have created a button and written a toggle function. And It was working for the first time, that is hiding the toolbar but the toolbar was not showing when I was clicking the button again. That's when the problem started, I was just scratching my head that what possibly can go wrong in a simple button.\n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPtSva6sg3rX9oHhnHtdo9Rr2xWaUi9q8NHXD7MuBvBYF)</center>\nPC : https://me.me\n\nAfter like 2 hours of overthinking, I fixed the bug. What was happening is that to rerender the child component, there should be some kind of event which has to be passed to child component and readOnly props was not doing it. So what I have done is to create a key, and in every button click I was sending a new key to the component. \n\nVoila !!! my code worked again. It's always nice to learn something new and I can proudly say that I have learned that today :)","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"stem\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"dblog\",\"busy\",\"marlians\",\"technology\",\"zzan\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/me.me\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPtSva6sg3rX9oHhnHtdo9Rr2xWaUi9q8NHXD7MuBvBYF\"]}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":40,"numPages":74,"currentPage":5}}}
