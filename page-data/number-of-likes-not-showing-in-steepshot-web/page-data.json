Though it is on the alpha phase it is actively being developed. \n\nI encountered a bug today while using it, when you load https://alpha.steepshot.io it will show you all the photos, however, some of the photos it is showing 0 likes below the photo but when you click it, it loads a pop up where it shows the number of people liked it. \n\nAs you can see below, it is showing 0 likes but when I clicked it shows 5 people have liked it.\n\n![ezgif.com-optimize.gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1512554488/wzkjbiafe6hefglx1qyt.gif)\n\n### Expected Behaviour \n\nThe expected behaviour that it should show the number of likes below the Photo also. For example it should show 5 instead of 0 under the image.\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome - Latest Version\n\n### Steps to Recreate the Error\n\n1. Open https://alpha.steepshot.io\n2. Click on any image having 0 likes.\n3. The pop up will open up which shows the number of people liked it\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/number-of-likes-not-showing-in-steepshot-web\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"December 06, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Number of Likes Not Showing in Steepshot Web","permlink":"number-of-likes-not-showing-in-steepshot-web","previous":{"title":"Color Challenge - Monday Red - Old Vehicle","permlink":"color-challenge-monday-red-old-vehicle-2017124t2133152z"},"next":{"title":"Colourfulphotography - A Big Christmas Tree","permlink":"colourfulphotography-a-big-christmas-tree"}}}}
