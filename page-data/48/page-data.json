These thoughts are actually creating a negative atmosphere around you. In this fast-moving world, everyone wants a quick solution to every problem. Everyone wants to be rich and that too instant without doing any hard work. And if someone does not get it, they think that they are not capable of doing it.\n\nLet me tell you a story\n\nHave you seen a Chinese bamboo tree, it looks like something below.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZSmBV2jcn6D7qdnxud5G17DYv3wVJPEjA9gcgeSJ92dF/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/bamboo-forest-nature-green-natural-1886974/)\n\nTo grow one you have to follow a strict rule, in which you have to water it every single day for 5 years. Yes 5 Years, if you fail any single day the tree will die. Now after 5 years staying below the ground, this tree will climb up to 90 feet in another 2 months. \n\nThe moral of this story is simple, have patience. You can also read my previous post on [Patience is the Key to Success](https://steemit.com/life/@codingdefined/lets-discuss-patience-is-the-key-to-success). \n\nNow coming back to the post if you think you are getting a lot of Negative thoughts and you want to forget it completely. To disappoint you, I must say that there is nothing which can completely make you forget those thoughts and you should also don't indulge yourself in things that will help you forgot things for a shorter time. I have a better alternatives, start doing any of these things :)\n\n- Read a book.\n- Watch an inspirational video.\n- Watch a ted talk.\n- Help Someone with something.\n- Exercise\n- Or whatever you feel like which will keep you happy\n\nThese things not only change your mood but also give you a feeling of empowerment because a small positive momentum will help you to move towards positive direction. This positive momentum can do wonders, they can take you places which you wouldn't have think of. Just start a baby step towards positive direction and Don't give up / Don't give in. Where there's a will, there's a way\n\n<hr>\n\n###  <center> Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"motivation\",\"philosophy\",\"writing\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZSmBV2jcn6D7qdnxud5G17DYv3wVJPEjA9gcgeSJ92dF\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/bamboo-forest-nature-green-natural-1886974\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/life\\/@codingdefined\\/lets-discuss-patience-is-the-key-to-success\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e49668b1-67ec-58fe-ab63-57a46874d1ab","title":"Rickysphotochallenge Week 11 Entry - Architecture - Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 19, 2017","permlink":"rickysphotochallenge-week-11-entry-architecture-vidhana-soudha-bangalore","body":"## <center>Namaste, below Entry is for #Rickysphotochallenge contest by @rickyjrx.

As you might have searched 100 of times that which programming language to start coding with and end up getting so many results that makes you confused. If you go to [List of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) in Wikipedia you will end up getting 1000 of programming languages into existence. Thus to simplify things for the beginners I have written this post that which programming language you should start with if you are completely new in programming.\n\nHere I will list down some of the programming languages which you can start coding almost instantly. I will not go in deep about what all the different categories of programming languages out there, what is the difference between them bla bla. My sole motto of this article would be to share with you guys that which programming language you can start almost instantly.\n\nList of Programming Languages to start with if you are completely new in programming.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> JavaScript </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**JavaScript** - When I have started my coding journey I have started with JavaScript and that is what I will recommend you all too. JavaScript is a client side scripting language (which runs on users browser) which is used for front-end development (means what you see in front of you in teh browser). The advantage of JavaScript is that it is compatible across all the browsers and it is very easy to learn. Steemit web front is also written in JavaScipt as shown below.\n\n![steemit1.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNunjBnogn9ur9NJXoyc6btCMganypHtRkYuerYt47QVr/steemit1.JPG)\n\nNow have I said that it is used in creating only client side, then Sorry, Javascript can also be used as a server-side language through the Node.js Platform. Now if you know JavaScript you can create a full fledge website like Steemit (showing front end to the users along with HTML, getting the data from the database using Node.js etc).\n\nSince I have shared with you how easy is to start with JavaScript, then you should also keep in mind that sometimes it becomes very difficult to debug this when the program gets bigger and bigger. If you are convinced on starting with JavaScript as your fiest language then there is no better platform then [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) which is a community that helps you learn to code with a very interactive style of teaching. It is 100% free to start with.\n\nI have even created a Ball Bouncing Game (https://codepen.io/codingdefined/pen/YyvLQZ) using HTML5 and JavaScript which shows how easy is to create a game if you know JavaScript. And please don't play the game now, complete the article first :P.\n\n![steemit2.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQrowsK2xp4AyrawgefiQGLyLE5mZCdz27SEgGAV3YT3a/steemit2.JPG)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Ruby </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**Ruby** - Ruby is one of the easiest programming language to learn. It is considered as a High-Level Programming language which means you do not have to write a lot of code to make computer understand what exactly you want your computer to do. The advantage of Ruby is that it reads like English and you can actually write down all the commands by just using English language words. If you want to lean Ruby, you just have to spare 20 minutes of your time. You might be thinking I am kidding, but no check out [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) it will teach you ruby in 20 minutes.\n\nThe best quote about Ruby I liked is \"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body\"\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Python</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**Python** - Not the Snake Python but a programming language. Just before getting to know more about Python, I would like to state that it is #1 choice in U.S. as an introdcutory language for a newbies. Again it is a very easy to learn programming language and it definately provides a steeping stone into the world of programming. Main advantage of using Pythin is the simplicity of its code thus allowing the beginners to grasp it very easily.\n\nIf you really want to learn Python then nothing can beat [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-program-using-python-utarlingtonx-cse1309x) which gives free online courses.\n\nNow I usually use JavaScript in all my projects. The advantage or importance of using it is that I do not have to learn any other language if I wanted to build a full web application. So if you want to start your coding journey I would definately recommend these three languages above.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Follow @codingdefined </center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"mspl\",\"steemdev\",\"programming\",\"technology\",\"coding\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmNunjBnogn9ur9NJXoyc6btCMganypHtRkYuerYt47QVr\\/steemit1.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQrowsK2xp4AyrawgefiQGLyLE5mZCdz27SEgGAV3YT3a\\/steemit2.JPG\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/List_of_programming_languages\",\"https:\\/\\/www.freecodecamp.org\",\"https:\\/\\/codepen.io\\/codingdefined\\/pen\\/YyvLQZ\",\"https:\\/\\/www.ruby-lang.org\\/en\\/documentation\\/quickstart\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/www.edx.org\\/course\\/learn-program-using-python-utarlingtonx-cse1309x\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"065ec8e0-cb6e-5b97-80ec-b15c87121ec9","title":"📷 Contest - #architecturalphotography - Shree Shyam Mandir, Bangalore, India 📷","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 17, 2017","permlink":"contest-architecturalphotography-shree-shyam-mandir-bangalore-india","body":"## <center>Namaste, below Entry is for #architecturalphotography contest by @juliank </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center> This image was taken at Bannerghatta, Bangalore, India.

What exactly is Patience? Let's Discuss.\n\n# <center> A Note on Patience</center>\n<hr>\n\nIn simple terms, Patience means that you have dedicated all your energy and effort to achieve any specific goals.  Your self-confidence and your determined effort help you to forget everything else, you ignore praises as well as you do not stop even when you are criticized and also you do not when there is a mountain of obstacles standing right in front of you. When you need to achieve your goals and climb the stair of success you need this effort, the weapon of Patience. \n\nIf you look closely you will see Patience is everywhere. Just take an example of Mother Earth, is it not Patiently enduring all our lovelessness or selflessness etc. There are numerous example like parents endure many things for their children, employees endure their employees. Why go far and outside, are we not here in Steemit patiently waiting so that our work will be recognized and we will continue to do that because we know that hard work always pays off we just have to continue doing what we are doing.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmchmYSGFhAxXtZRMqiMHU8EpMckdbHeGf3oUXMpyw1FzB/image.png)\nPC : [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pictoquotes/15222148434)\n\nI can see there are a lot of people who get frustrated or angry because they are not able to succeed here in Steemit. But, we need to understand that when we will become truly patient feeling like this will never arise. I am not saying that there are 100% times that you will not feel frustrated or you will not get angry. You will, but you need to overcome it because you have to focus on your goals. \n\nI can only say that you will never get success very quickly in life (like Rome was not built in a day). There are numerous of difficulties standing in your way when you try to become successful or try to achieve something in life. But if you have the determination and if you are optimistic then the power of bearing the pain or facing the difficulty will come naturally. This is where our mental attitude plays a big role to define are we strong or weak to face any difficulties.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTczmkxZgUAFqSstpGRJRciFfS2KV6wf5nX3j1khbndLC/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/fishing-rocks-sea-horizon-person-1606352/)\n\nI will conclude the discussion by saying that along with Patience we need to keep Right Attitude even in the situations when we feel helpless or when we feel nothing is working for us. Thus Patience is the Key to Success and with Right Attitude and Patience, we can move mountains.\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"motivation\",\"philosophy\",\"spirituality\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmchmYSGFhAxXtZRMqiMHU8EpMckdbHeGf3oUXMpyw1FzB\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmTczmkxZgUAFqSstpGRJRciFfS2KV6wf5nX3j1khbndLC\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/pictoquotes\\/15222148434\",\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/fishing-rocks-sea-horizon-person-1606352\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b6f9606a-6a6a-525d-b0ea-0b884c5af258","title":"📷 Contest - #macrophotography -  Flower Petals 📷","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 14, 2017","permlink":"contest-macrophotography-flower-petals","body":"## <center>Namaste from India, below Entry is for #macrophotography contest by @juliank </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center> Location : Office in Bangalore, India </center>\n## <center> Camera Used : Nokia 6 Mobile Camera - 16 MP, No Editing done </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center> Flower Petals </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170914_174741.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmS7p5avjbhScwr1ZZJFB5S3Pg5BMaZxCh9uzZu5v733zj/IMG_20170914_174741.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> If you liked my work, please do follow @codingdefined </center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"macrophotography\",\"photography\",\"flowers\",\"nature\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"juliank\",\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmS7p5avjbhScwr1ZZJFB5S3Pg5BMaZxCh9uzZu5v733zj\\/IMG_20170914_174741.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"5f5a4cb9-3158-539e-a3f1-c3244bb37b58","title":"Color Challenge - Thursday Green - Nisargadhama Bridge View in Coorg, India","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 14, 2017","permlink":"color-challenge-thursday-green-nisargadhama-bridge-view-in-coorg-india","body":"# <center> Namaste, Have a great day everyone</center>\n\n### <center> My entries for today's #colorchallenge by @kalemandra</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>These pictures were taken on my recent trip to Coorg - The Scotland of India.
