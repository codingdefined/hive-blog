Well, around here avocados are eaten almost religiously and this avocado ranch is such an awesome way to showcase them. It is so good with these egg rolls.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (6).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeAbUqpRNDUAHNX7GGrjLuyAoYfxSikkWcYojLBsC7tz7/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(6).jpg)</center>\n\nOkay, so I’m not gonna lie, photographing these egg rolls totally kicked my butt. In fact, I may never try taking pictures of egg rolls again. I’ll add it to my new year’s resolutions or something.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (3).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdhMtKWSmLC3kPjDBGe62J2mUQ8LqfNhXu92GAHtUsBHp/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(3).jpg)</center>\n\nDon’t ask me why. I really don’t understand why the most innocent looking food can be so extremely difficult for me sometimes. I just couldn’t capture them the way that I wanted. I won’t even admit how long I spent trying to make them look the way I had planned.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce,.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeB7TxHNC1XCuqFZzDnJ1dzunvrKySy4maGAXvXP17imE/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%2C.jpg)</center>\n\nHonestly, my best photos are the ones that I take when I am relaxed and not trying to be a perfectionist. I think my mood shows through my photography. If I am having a bad day or just not all that excited about a recipe then it’s a sure bet the pictures are going to suck. For example, my camera had been misbehaving this day and the weather was creating the worst possible lighting which had me doing nothing short of dancing around trying to keep up and capture the right moments. The point is that it just wasn’t happening, I was frustrated, and I came very close to scratching the entire thing.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (7).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcPxgY8zobsk25ibYNUHEtoZ8DhRZiQDdfewZ2rzwdx4B/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(7).jpg)</center>\n\nOf course, after I had spent forever on these I would have felt even stupider than I already did about it if I didn’t at least get to share them with you guys. I think I’ve said this before and I know that I have told you not to let my amateur photography skills keep you from trying a recipe. I can at least say that these really are delicious. I made them for our Christmas party one year and called them “Feliz Navidad Rolls” or  “Santa Fe-egg Rolls”.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (2).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQzuPYwjXzN91CgAYcp6svFrjNCuaKUmnSxas9xkd2Hk7/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(2).jpg)</center>\n\nYeah, I know, I’m much cornier than these rolls are. Oh, and I forgot to mention that I made the wrappers from scratch. I’ve never seen egg roll or wonton wrappers in the stores here so I didn’t have much choice but even if you can buy them I recommend trying them at home at least once. You know, just to say you did. Plus it really impresses people. I hope you try them!\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (5).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZt5MHAYaTfcM773dRuangrQGWUuqaHfoity26HnW21CK/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(5).jpg)</center>\n\n![Gringalicious-border.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeAtgZKAWXwvgLCjVWGHdYkDXRjdGAWR4NXf3zxC5g2Y1/Gringalicious-border.png)\n<h2><center>**As always, the recipe is available upon request.

SURVIVAL GAME SEASON 4 RECAP + GAME OVERVIEW & NEW RULES FOR SEASON 5","author":"papa-pepper","created":"July 10, 2017","permlink":"steem-pocalypse-survival-game-season-4-recap-game-overview-and-new-rules-for-season-5","body":"http://i.imgur.com/fS6c6wr.jpg\n\n## <center>This has been an incredible adventure!</center>\n\n---------\nCreating, running, and improving the STEEM-Pocalypse Survival Game Contest has been amazing. First of all, I think that it gives some users a great reason to check in here on steemit *every* day. But even more than that, it inspires some users to interact in a way that they normally may not, which not only builds new friendships, but the community as well. Often in this game steemians who were previously strangers get thrown together into scenarios where they must work together in order to survive, and they have a lot of fun doing it. Of course the opportunity to win hundreds of dollars worth of SBD also has its own appeal.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>SEASON 4 RECAP</center>\n\n----------\nEach season has its own special place in my life. For Season 4, it was a great opportunity for the largest participation so far. There is no way that I want to limit or restrict participation, so I will do my best to always keep this contest open to all. Because of that, I am presuming that more and more steemians will participate in each new season, so Season 5 may have *hundreds* of people signing up initially. Since it is an elimination game, most will eventually have to die, but at least whoever wants to join in can at least give themselves the opportunity to win.\n\nIn Season 4, I implemented a *solo play* to begin with. Individual steemians had to consistently check in on a daily basis to prove their availability and commitment.  This was to help streamline the gameplay and make sure that people playing were actually going to be playing the game. I know that situations arise where not everyone can be available each day, but to move the gameplay forward I need participants to be committed to check in and make decisions once every 24 hour period.\n\nAnother change for Season 4 is that during the beginning solo play, players got the opportunity to collect resources which would come in handy later. Then, when some of them teamed up, they had more to work with. I think that this added an interesting variable to the gameplay and worked well.\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/YUOX7hw.png\n\nAs will potentially happen with more participants, Season 4 lasted the longest of any season so far too. Since the prize pool increases on a daily basis, this meant the largest prize pool so far too! The winner, @jznsamuel, took home 825 SBD out of the total prize pool of 1100 SBD. It is crazy to think that someone could make so much money just by playing a game for a few minutes online each day, but that is the opportunity that the STEEM-Pocalypse Survival Game Contest can offer now because of steemit!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>GAME OVERVIEW</center>\n\n----------\n\nFor those of you who are new to this game or unfamiliar with how it works. here is a simple overview of the general concept to help you understand.\n\nBasically, this game is a \"choose your own adventure\" style story game. In each round, I come up with different scenarios in which the players must choose an option. Each option has a predetermined outcome, and some will eventually lead to death. As players die, the remaining ones continue playing until the last players die or only one player/team is left alive.\n\nDifferent variable and scenarios come up each round, some of which are based on reality and are more educational and others are just random scenarios that I come up with. By using their knowledge, researching skills, or maybe just guessing the players attempt to pass each round. Situations like avoiding starvation and staying hydrated are mixed in with various perils and dangerous scenarios. I try to keep it fun, yet challenging.\n\nEach player has the responsibility to reply to each new post within 24 hours with their decision based on the options given. Simply put, if you are capable of accessing your steemit account, reading my latest STEEM-Pocalypse post, and replying with the number of the option that you are choosing, you will be able to play.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>THOSE RANDOM GEMS</center>\n\n----------\nIn each season, there seem to be some players that rise above the rest and make the game much more entertaining to watch and follow. Whether it is former strangers like @bilbop & @clayboyn teaming up and having some excellent team discussions in the comment section of each post or a talented writing like @trevor.george posting his own original story based on the decisions that his team made in the game, this game can get pretty entertaining. \n\nIn the previous two seasons, @gregory-f and @provider managed to team up and this last season they almost won it, but finished in third place after some wild dogs ate them. Their interaction as \"**The Dukes of Hazzards**\" has been fun to read for these last few seasons.\n\nThe star player of last season was @keepdoodling, who replied with a doodle for each round as well as their decision. After losing their original partner, they got a new teammate, @bycz, and finished in second place, each taking home 137.5 SBD. Check out these incredible drawings from last season!\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/m7Tfg84.png</center>\n\nThey even had some fun with @papa-pepper last season too! In one round, the players had to choose how to proceed after encountering this situation.\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/s20myoO.jpg\n\nA man was lying on the ground, and the players did not know if he was in need of help or if it was a trap. @Keepdoodling took a guess at what the situation was.\n\n----------\n> ###  I'm pretty sure that I figured out what is going on there. It's obviously that we see how @papa-pepper is having a nice chat with his wild friend about things they are exited about:\n\n<center>https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://image.ibb.co/douvsv/postgame17.png</center>\n\n---------------\nAfter my recent post about one of my wild friends, it was a very timely guess as to why I would be lying on the ground like that.\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/tISa7J9.jpg\n\n\nTheir doodles went even further that round with this gem.\n\n-------------\n> ### Of course I wanna help to papa-pepper if he needs it (he needs some shoes I guess), but not sure it's polite to interfere right know. I'll go with any option except shooting at papa-pepper - it would be totally rude :)\n\n<center>https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://image.ibb.co/dEhVcv/postgame18.png</center>\n\n--------------\nPersonally, I thought that was a hilarious and very intelligent set of doodles, and it really impressed me. Of course not everyone has to embellish the gameplay or story-line in any way, simply replying with the number of their choice is all that is required. It is interesting to see how *some* players take things to a whole different level though. It makes it a lot more entertaining to follow the contest. \n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eDZh2yV.png\n\n## <center>SEASON 5 RULES</center>\n\n----------\n\nIn many ways, Season 5 will run a lot like Season 4. Individual players will have to make it past the beginning days in order to proceed. Players who do not reply within the 24 hour response period for each round will be eliminated. Players who make it past the initial rounds will be provided with opportunities to team up.\n\nI will post the Season 5 Sign-up Post sometime tomorrow. **ONLY PLAYERS WHO SIGN UP BY REPLYING TO THAT POST WILL BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE.** Unlike previous seasons, I will allow for a few days of sign up time instead of only a 24 hour window. This will help allow any interested steemians time to join in. To help make sure that people do not miss it, I will request that anyone who wants to help out wait a day or two and then resteem that sign up post. This will help with visibility.\n\nIn the previous seasons, I have done almost all the tracking of player choices and inventory documentation manually. This means that I go through the previous post, check *every* reply, copy the usernames into groups, and then post that information in the comment section. Some days, this takes hours of work for me to finish, especially early on in the season when there are so many players. Again, I do not want to restrict the number of players who can join in, so I am going to put more responsibility on the players this season.\n\nIn Season 5, each player with have to keep track of their own inventory, at least at first. If your player finds a pistol with two rounds of ammunition and a firestarter, then your replies should look something like this:\n\n> I choose Option 2 today. I have a pistol with two bullets and a firestarter.\n\n----------\n\nIt will be a lot easier for me to be able to focus on running the game if I do not have to keep track of every item that hundreds of players have every choice that they make. Also, when you have the chance to win hundreds of dollars worth of SBD, I do not think that it is too much for me to ask of you. Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nSince individual players will be keeping track of their own moves and inventory, the potential for players to be dishonest will arise. A player who makes a decision that gets them nothing in a round may be tempted to claim that they found a pistol. Please do not lie to me. Each decision will be documented on the blockchain, so you will be found out. Also, I will ban you from participation in any of my contest for a time. I do believe in forgiveness, so I will not permanently ban you, but you will have to sit out for a few seasons. I wish that I did not have to say things like this, but since I am giving more responsibility to the players, I felt that I should cover my bases. Please do not let your greed ruin my generosity. \n\n***Also, I've teamed up with @liberty-minded to provide something special and new for Season 5. For now it is a secret, but you will all see it soon enough. Stay tuned!***\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n# <center>I'll do the signup post tomorrow!

Am I really working on raising consciousness or am I just a slave teaching the best ways to stay enslaved to this world online?  I am not sure.\r\n22. Do we already have eternal life right this moment without the need to do anything or have done anything to earn it?  That feels like the truth to me.\r\n23. How do we know if we are truly helping and being of service today?  Are upvotes and comments the best way to tell?  How about views?\r\n24. Is the purpose of life to learn how to love?  Those with Near Death Experiences or NDEs seem to consistently agree on this point.  It feels true to me.\r\n25. What do I need to do today to love unconditionally in each situation?  Keep writing this post or do something else?\r\n26. Why do we accomplish so much during the day and then go to bed at night feeling like we did not do enough?  Still trying to work this one out.\r\n27. When is it time to stop hustling, end fantasy, and enjoy the future which is today that we worked so hard for yesterday?  Am I doing that now or is this just more hustling?  At what point is the bank account big enough to just take a day off and not think about it?\r\n28. Would anyone still follow me if they saw me picking my nose and eating the booger which I could not even spell without spellcheck?  After our almost two year old daughter had finished picking a booger and was about to eat it, my wife started to explain about how dirty it was and why she should not eat it.  I did not say anything because it seems I am just too lazy to go to the bathroom and try to throw it down the sick and wash my hands.  I mean it was in my nose how dirty can it be?\r\n29. Is it courageous or disgusting to share intimate body details like above?  Maybe a bit of both?\r\n30. Why does the idea of posting naked pictures of myself feel so vulnerable when my body is my most beautiful creation which I have been working on for nearly 34 years?  If my friends did it, I probably would too.  The world would probably be a happier place if we all felt comfortable being naked.  That would be a lot of motivation to make a diet one enjoyed and stick to it.  Maybe I should try a nudist colony.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading the next ten questions I have asked in my new series where I share ten questions I think about each day because I hope this helps with feeling connected and raising our collective consciousness to see the big beautiful world we live in!

I haven’t  seen it for a long time . Why do I  say so? Because now it is a hot summer, the radish has grown up  and this kind of green radish leaves are very rare.  I usually cook it with soybean , that is the best group.  the children born after 80 and 90 may not have eaten this Dongdong, those born after 60, 70 may know this my favorite dish - that is, radish small tofu. As long as I see this dish, I can’t wait to eat it without other dishes . It can make me happy when I am full . it is  really a delicious and nutritious food which I am always eager to eat. So ,you will ask “ on earth , what is it ? how can I do it ? Can you tell me what to do?”  Well,  now let me explain this simple, delicious and nutritious food . It is not only good for the ladies but also for the men . a professor in the US said : “ Men who can eat soybeans can be the trun man”.  Ok , so don’t miss it , see how I can cook this easy but delicious food . \n\n### Material : radish leaves, soak soy beans (6-12 hours), oil, salt, monosodium glutamate\n\n\n![两样原料.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRnk6eXeTcN1GsAQz95zBSu7FA7QrihXuRoLLhmQFLUq7/%E4%B8%A4%E6%A0%B7%E5%8E%9F%E6%96%99.jpg)\n\n### Methods: \n\n### 1. Wash radish leaves, boiled with water short time and pull out . Then put them in the cold water, chopped, spare . \n\n\n![洗净的萝卜缨.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmb7JwBMnNzJ8mVAE6Rg6X57joR4XBGZUDruJNQJvsVJfh/%E6%B4%97%E5%87%80%E7%9A%84%E8%90%9D%E5%8D%9C%E7%BC%A8.jpg)\n\n\n![料好的萝卜缨.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRQcF7k9r2yoMc4j9kuEZP94LG7sbJEQJGaxxsFYpCvby/%E6%96%99%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%90%9D%E5%8D%9C%E7%BC%A8.jpg)\n\n\n\n### 2. soak the soybean, crush with crusher\n\n![豆浆机榨.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYuhkA4EoEzsdf9tw5ds4erywu4KSLGY1Fhfo13uxUuiJ/%E8%B1%86%E6%B5%86%E6%9C%BA%E6%A6%A8.jpg)\n\n\n\n### 3. Fill the pot with soybean oil. less than usual, because the beans themselves are very fragrant.\n\n![炒小豆腐1.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdqPZ9TchzsemgzMagcKXcxmmk1fvTJmBiBdChRDysNJR/%E7%82%92%E5%B0%8F%E8%B1%86%E8%85%901.jpg)\n\n\n### 4.

Place chopped radish leaves and stir fry. Fill in the water and cook it with little fire. Because big fire can make it burnt easily . \n\n### 6. At this time, you must see the pot and pay attention whether it is burnt or not . Cooked in about 10 minutes.\n### 7. Put some salt , monosodium glutamate , taste it whether it is cooked well . Put them in a bowl or a plate . It’s finished . \n\n\n![小盘.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP9nKewD7SH5cbL6ZUbHhKpjVHUbiVUjmpjw8nFX2tUSd/%E5%B0%8F%E7%9B%98.jpg)\n\n\n\n![QQ图片20170710121242.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY1EXcRxt2wFirbCWmjDY22mJSgWBpPaKD9YTnWobyfgm/QQ%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8720170710121242.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Would you like to try this radish small tofu? Easy to do and easy to eat , especially to those people whose teeth are not good . it is nutritious and healthy . what are you waiting for? In Spring , you can do it with pickpurse, that is called “pickpurse small tofu” . You can also cook it with seaweed , that is seaweed small tofu . but to me , I still prefer pickpurse and radish.\n### Enjoy my post ? do not forget to upvote me! Stay here and leave a message. Welcome !\n\n\n\n\n\n  昨天早上去市场的时候， 终于发现了我好久都没见到的最爱-萝卜缨，哈哈，为啥这么说呢？ 因为现在是炎热的夏天嘛， 小萝卜缨早都没了，即使是这种长大点的绿色的萝卜缨也很少见， 那么我把它跟谁匹配才能发挥它最好的效果呢？ 没错， 那就是黄豆啦。 80后， 90后的孩子们可能没吃过这个东东，60后，70后的哥哥姐妹们也许知道这个我最喜欢的菜- 那就是萝卜缨小豆腐。 我见了这道菜，简直命都可以不要， 而且有了它，我再也不眷顾别的菜品了， 捧着一个碗就可以吃个肚儿圆， 对我来说那真叫一个美味， 更何况又营养丰富呢！说道这，有人可能说了，你扯了半天， 倒底是什么嘛？ 能不能说说咋做的呢？那好吧， 卖了这么大一通的关子， 让我来详解这道简单易学，好吃又营养的最爱吧，尤其是女士哦，那可是美容养颜，富含卵磷脂滴！男士也不要错过哦， 因为有美国教授说过：“真正的男人从吃大豆开始”。 哈哈， 先上个成品图，可能卖相不够， 但是价值肯定是杠杠的！因为都是纯天然，绿色食品哦。\n\n\n  原料： 萝卜缨 泡好的黄豆（6-12小时）油 盐 味精 \n  过程：\n1.\t洗好萝卜缨， 用开水过一下，捞出，凉水投凉 ，切碎，备用。 \n2.\t泡好的黄豆用粉碎机 粉碎 \n3.\t锅里填点豆油，可以比平时做菜少放点， 因为黄豆本身就很香。\n4.\t葱花爆锅，炒出香味，放粉碎好的黄豆。\n5.\t放入切碎的萝卜缨，翻炒。填水， 小火慢炖。 火大了易糊锅底。 \n6.\t这时候也要不停的看有没有糊锅底。大约 10分钟左右熟了。 \n7.\t将炒好的小豆腐，放盐， 味素调味，可以出炉了！\n这款萝卜缨小豆腐你是不是可以尝试一下呢？ 做起来简单， 吃起来也省事，不像吃黄豆， 牙口不好的嚼起来费劲， 这个好啊， 基本连蔬菜加饭都有了， 营养又健康， 你还等什么呢？ 春天可以用荠菜做，就是荠菜小豆腐，格外的一种味道。 跟海菜放一起就海菜小豆腐，但个人觉得还是荠菜和萝卜缨好吃。 \n喜欢我的帖子， 别忘了点赞哦！光顾的留个脚印吧， 欢迎留言！","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"health\",\"food\",\"life\",\"photography\",\"cn\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRnk6eXeTcN1GsAQz95zBSu7FA7QrihXuRoLLhmQFLUq7\\/%E4%B8%A4%E6%A0%B7%E5%8E%9F%E6%96%99.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmb7JwBMnNzJ8mVAE6Rg6X57joR4XBGZUDruJNQJvsVJfh\\/%E6%B4%97%E5%87%80%E7%9A%84%E8%90%9D%E5%8D%9C%E7%BC%A8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRQcF7k9r2yoMc4j9kuEZP94LG7sbJEQJGaxxsFYpCvby\\/%E6%96%99%E5%A5%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%90%9D%E5%8D%9C%E7%BC%A8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYuhkA4EoEzsdf9tw5ds4erywu4KSLGY1Fhfo13uxUuiJ\\/%E8%B1%86%E6%B5%86%E6%9C%BA%E6%A6%A8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmdqPZ9TchzsemgzMagcKXcxmmk1fvTJmBiBdChRDysNJR\\/%E7%82%92%E5%B0%8F%E8%B1%86%E8%85%901.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ7J1cpGkhdLfQPvrrVMVJxHeuqCRQ9sgcw49bV8DNa1K\\/QQ%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8720170710120955.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmf1CgpCdEH6kgyB1cz4jeBNYuJriQ8gZHY6sn61TGns9S\\/%E7%82%92.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmP9nKewD7SH5cbL6ZUbHhKpjVHUbiVUjmpjw8nFX2tUSd\\/%E5%B0%8F%E7%9B%98.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmY1EXcRxt2wFirbCWmjDY22mJSgWBpPaKD9YTnWobyfgm\\/QQ%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8720170710121242.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"87c7c4fc-3311-5c9e-aed6-352f96fcec32","title":"An afternoon in Chapel bridge, Lucerne","author":"aburmeseabroad","created":"July 10, 2017","permlink":"an-afternoon-in-chapel-bridge-lucerne-or-switzerland-travel-2","body":"Dear Steemians,\n\n\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/6rn17ulfz/IMG_9341.jpg\n\n**Since many of you have enjoyed the first article from swiss travel series, I am going to share more.
