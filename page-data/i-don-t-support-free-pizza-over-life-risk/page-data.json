Do you know the pizza guy have to risk his life to get you the pizza on time. \n\nIt did happen in front of me today. I was going by my motorbike and saw a pizza delivery guy just overtook me, since it was raining an there was a traffic he has to apply brake which makes his motorbike skid and thus he fall. What if there was no traffic and he skids in the middle of the road and get hit by a truck. \n\nWhich actually made me realise that it's so hard for the pizza guys as they had to risk their life for delivering the pizza on time. Just take an example a guy has ordered a pizza for $10 and if that is not delivered on time it will be deducted from the delivery guy salary, that means around 2.5% of the guys income considering he earns around $400 a month.\n\nI do not support this free pizza culture even though it is late because if I have to get the pizza I will order little early rather than asking them to come before 30 minutes. I can say that 50% of my pizza delivery where above 30 minutes even though I have never asked for free pizza because I can pay for that pizza and it's a whole livelihood for the delivery guy.\n\nWhat do you think?","created":"September 23, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"I don't support Free Pizza over life risk","permlink":"i-don-t-support-free-pizza-over-life-risk","previous":{"title":"On your product development team, which function is the most important player for setting product vision","permlink":"on-your-product-development-team-which-function-is-the-most-important-player-for-setting-product-vision"},"next":{"title":"Mysore Palace - Full View","permlink":"mysore-palace-full-view"}}}}
