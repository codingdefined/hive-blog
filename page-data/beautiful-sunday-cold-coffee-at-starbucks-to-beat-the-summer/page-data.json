So that's why I visited one of the best coffee shops at least in Bangalore that is Starbucks Coffee. I have never visited to starbucks before, so it was my first experience though I have heard a lot about it saying it is one of the best coffee maker. The ambience of the store looks great with lighting and all. \n\n![IMG_20180225_173025.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXC5wjFNTWxLi21S1GaaZgGUs52vk4UKdFKoLhJ5t5qtr/IMG_20180225_173025.jpg)\n\nOne thing I noticed and I failed to understand that why you need a smartphone when you can just chat face to face. Are the healthy conversation just remain only through online messages and no one wants to talk to anyone directly. As I was sitting in one corner I saw two sets of people one who is actively engaging in conversations whereas others who was busy in phones. \n\n![IMG_20180225_172419.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQsjE9g6PwB2LwqhsvtVicAmoMUmnntzUkTXhNVn78EZg/IMG_20180225_172419.jpg)\n\nWe have ordered the latest arrivals in Cold Coffee which is Calamel with Chocolate Icecream Cold Coffee, yeah I know the name seems mouth watering so does the coffee. We have to wait for like 20 minutes for our coffee to arrive, but the wait was worth it. And the mandatory Starbucks coffee glass photo :P\n\n![IMG_20180225_172745.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTagkYH9qf4R1CLi8BrVyx69bJ2jRFNM7jKqhPH7TZbtx/IMG_20180225_172745.jpg)\n\nThe coffee looks mouth watering and yummy with so many flavors in it. And it's correct though, you will love Starbucks coffee.\n\n![IMG_20180225_170554.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP7K6c3FPaaBobf9jjP6nv1sGSQ1DJJ9ZcoJSKxK1KtW6/IMG_20180225_170554.jpg)","created":"March 04, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Beautiful Sunday - Cold Coffee at Starbucks to beat the Summer","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-cold-coffee-at-starbucks-to-beat-the-summer","previous":{"title":"Happy Holi to All","permlink":"happy-holi-to-all"},"next":{"title":"Clear Cache Extension to clear the Cache","permlink":"clear-cache-extension-to-clear-the-cache"}}}}
