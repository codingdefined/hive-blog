Please join me in thanking @liberty-minded for his generous gift! Thanks man!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>@jonny-clearwater</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FlBXJO5.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2num6ax.jpg\n\nThis incredible t-shirt was sent as a trade that we worked out. I sent him one of my handmade \"DON'T POST FOR FREE - steemit.com\" shirts and he mailed me one of these that he designed! Very cool stuff and an excellent trade. Check out @jonny-clearwater and/or his wife @flowerpowerart if you have not already done so. Thanks! I'll be wearing it!\n\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## <center>@louiscpt</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DGikP3A.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EbQx5AN.jpg\n\nA huge pile of gifts came to me all the way from South Africa. Check out the personalized envelope, and the interesting stamps. If that wasn't enough, you'll have to look at what was inside!\n\n--------------\nhttp://i.imgur.com/II02R73.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Moh5Nrm.jpg\n\nFirst off, I received this incredible, personalized, embroidered long-sleeve STEEM-POCALYPSE shirt! This was huge! What a gift!\n\n-----------------\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UIbFzLL.jpg\n\nThen, there was this amazing STEEM-POCALYPSE hat that not only featured my favorite color (camouflage) but it also actually fit on my giant head! Super cool.\n\n--------------\nhttp://i.imgur.com/McxJy6n.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gwfG0la.jpg\n\nAnd.... if that wasn't enough (and it was) I also found this fantastic t-shirt inside. Another personalized shirt featuring the STEEM-POCALYPSE logo, the @papa-pepper logo, *and* a photo of me holding one of my Wild Friends, the Pygmy Rattlesnake! This was mind-blowing! What a great set of gifts! You guys should definitely check out what else @louiscpt has been up to on his blog page.\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n## <center>PAPA LOVES THIS STUFF!</center>\n\nI know that even though I've been on steemit for almost a year now I am still a newcomer to online interaction and social media. I also know that many may consider giving out mailing addresses and meeting people from the internet in person to be some big \"no-nos.\" However, I'm still new at all of this, and so far the steemit community has seriously impressed me.\n\nThese gifts are just one small example of how steemit has taken things to an entirely different level that what so many other online platforms have achieved. Honestly, I am so blessed to be a part of this steemit community and you guys mean a lot to me. Steem on my friends, steem on!\n\nhttps://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/uVNBbyL.jpg\n\n## As always, I'm @papa-pepper and here's the proof:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JBFNKlm.jpg\nproof-of-some-of-the-best-mail-ever\n\n--------------\n----------\n#### <center>Until next time…</center>\n## <center>Don’t waste your time online, *invest* it with steemit.com</center>\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://gifmaker.me/files/download/home/20170610/12/5DTW6RM44sGCW1GzoIqDK7/output_J9du6L.gif\n\n-------------\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmWJLBUEQKrsCFYNSpzTSiRPbR8AT45ZpwbjgCX5ucQaDN/image.png\n### <center>[TO TRANSLATE POSTS VIA OPERATION TRANSLATION CLICK HERE](https://steemit.com/translation/@papa-pepper/operation-translation-now-under-construction-what-it-is-and-how-you-can-help)</center>","created":"July 04, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"INCREDIBLE MAIL FROM AN AMAZING COMMUNITY - YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS!","permlink":"incredible-mail-from-an-amazing-community-you-ve-gotta-see-this","previous":{"title":"Best Time to Buy EOS or Any New Cryptocurrency?","permlink":"best-time-to-buy-eos-or-any-new-cryptocurrency"},"next":{"title":"Steemcleaner Report for July 2, 2017 Part 2","permlink":"steemcleaner-report-for-july-2-2017-part-2"}}}}
