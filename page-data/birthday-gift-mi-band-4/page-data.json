I had my birthday on 18th November, and my wife knew that I wanted to buy a fitness band for a long. So, without informing me she has bought Mi Band 4 and gifted me on my birthday, it was a surprise and I totally liked it. \n\nThere are a lot of features in the band as work out details, heart rate monitoring, weather and phone notifications, alarm, and music controls, etc directly from the band. To view the stats you need to download the Mi Fit app on your phone and you can customize your details accordingly. The text looks great and there is no issues in reading the text in bright sunlight. I started leaving my watch at home and using it for everything thus fewer pieces of equipment in hand to wear.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXJFfJB6sdCFTYWVA89rjbRWdCUJaea675TDbkHJTqYU2)\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTojgJj1ttM7SbuKJuZ8Jxt6VCMTyBUT9amDbmSUeRvYC)\n\nIt has a great design and the display looks dazzling. The Mi Band has comfortable straps and its easy to wear. You can actually wear it 24/7 without feeling a difference. It has a great battery like, where I have used it for a week and still the battery shows 79%, i.e. down by only 21%. One more thing I liked about the band is how accurate the count is. The walk tracking feature is fairly accurate and literally I have counted it and it does a great job in it. \n\n![_DSC0206.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUkCg9fEQjuZUxdBpckUBRYbyBMEQG2nTkp4Uy3WoAVcD)\n\nOne thing I don't like is that you need to remove the AMOLED display to charge it which eventually makes the band width increase which makes the display band prone to come out of the band.  The sleep tracking is fairly accurate too, yesterday I slept around 11:30 and woke up around 7, as you can see below.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbJWTat9MLmnrRUwxN97JVWz7wCJRxTGMsn6cFZgEznLH)\n\nThe price is on a higher side i.e. 40$, but overall its pocket-friendly. Overall it's a good band with a lot of features and if you love to track your activities it's a good buy and a good investment in yourself. It's also the best gift if you would like to give it to someone, people will really appreciate it.\n\n#### **The pros of the Band:**\n\n1. accuracy\n2. display\n3. waterproof\n4. good battery life\n5. pocket-friendly\n\nThe only con I can think of is how you charge the band and nothing else.
