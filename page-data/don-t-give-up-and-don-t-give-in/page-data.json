These thoughts are actually creating a negative atmosphere around you. In this fast-moving world, everyone wants a quick solution to every problem. Everyone wants to be rich and that too instant without doing any hard work. And if someone does not get it, they think that they are not capable of doing it.\n\nLet me tell you a story\n\nHave you seen a Chinese bamboo tree, it looks like something below.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZSmBV2jcn6D7qdnxud5G17DYv3wVJPEjA9gcgeSJ92dF/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/bamboo-forest-nature-green-natural-1886974/)\n\nTo grow one you have to follow a strict rule, in which you have to water it every single day for 5 years. Yes 5 Years, if you fail any single day the tree will die. Now after 5 years staying below the ground, this tree will climb up to 90 feet in another 2 months. \n\nThe moral of this story is simple, have patience. You can also read my previous post on [Patience is the Key to Success](https://steemit.com/life/@codingdefined/lets-discuss-patience-is-the-key-to-success). \n\nNow coming back to the post if you think you are getting a lot of Negative thoughts and you want to forget it completely. To disappoint you, I must say that there is nothing which can completely make you forget those thoughts and you should also don't indulge yourself in things that will help you forgot things for a shorter time. I have a better alternatives, start doing any of these things :)\n\n- Read a book.\n- Watch an inspirational video.\n- Watch a ted talk.\n- Help Someone with something.\n- Exercise\n- Or whatever you feel like which will keep you happy\n\nThese things not only change your mood but also give you a feeling of empowerment because a small positive momentum will help you to move towards positive direction. This positive momentum can do wonders, they can take you places which you wouldn't have think of. Just start a baby step towards positive direction and Don't give up / Don't give in. Where there's a will, there's a way\n\n<hr>\n\n###  <center> Follow @codingdefined</center>","created":"September 20, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Don't Give Up and Don't Give In","permlink":"don-t-give-up-and-don-t-give-in","previous":{"title":"Rickysphotochallenge Week 11 Entry - Architecture - Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore","permlink":"rickysphotochallenge-week-11-entry-architecture-vidhana-soudha-bangalore"},"next":{"title":"B&W Photo Contest - Theme Sunset / Sunrise - Multiple Entries","permlink":"b-and-w-photo-contest-theme-sunset-sunrise-multiple-entries"}}}}
