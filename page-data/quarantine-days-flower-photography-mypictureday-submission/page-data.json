Because of the strict lockdown in India from the last 21 days, I am not able to go outside. The lockdown has been extended for 19 days, so I went to my house terrace to click some photos. Though I could not find any good object to click, I found this wildflower. There are almost 100 of these flowers on the tree, I grabbed one to take Macro photography of it. I couldn't click pure macro shot because of the lens but got a full view of the flower.\n\nSo what you are doing in these Quarantine Days?\n\n![IMG_2388.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/9Rmnf6Rl-IMG_2388.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_2389.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/csOjAVGG-IMG_2389.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--|--\nLens |  EF-S 24MM F/2.8 STM LENS","created":"April 14, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Quarantine Days : Flower Photography - MyPictureDay Submission","permlink":"quarantine-days-flower-photography-mypictureday-submission","previous":{"title":"Should you Withdraw all your Investment","permlink":"should-you-withdraw-all-your-investment"},"next":{"title":"What Color Attracts?","permlink":"what-color-attracts"}}}}
