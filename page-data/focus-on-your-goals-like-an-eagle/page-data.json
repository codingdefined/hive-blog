It is so much required in this era to set your goals be it anything. You can start the goals as small as possible. The goal can be writing a blog post on Steemit (that's a very well defined goal).\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/The\\_eagle\\_says-\\_%22look\\_at\\_tha\\_boootey%22.jpg)\n\nBy Ashishpaul777 (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nNow since you have defined your goal, you have to be focused on your goals and the best way to be focused is to be like an Eagle. But why like an Eagle? Have you ever noticed an Eagle when it is waiting. They seem to be so majestic, poised and elegant when they patiently wait and scan the horizon. Now the real question is what Eagle does different.\n\n**Being Focus** - Eagles have the tremendous ability to be focus on things what matters the most to them and just ignore what does not matter to them.\n\n**Confidence in achieving something**- They seem to be the most confident when they see an opportunity. They know they will get success no matter what happens and they do not get anxious or frustrated easily.\n\n**Strong Foundation** - Eagle always try to strengthen their foundation thus giving them the advantage of sailing through whatever storm comes into their way.\n\nSo if you are not like an Eagle in any situation be it looking out for a new job, or getting the college admission or even getting a good post payout here in Steemit then my suggestion would become an Eagle. Turn into an Eagle, you will sail through your goals easily.\n\n## **Upvote, Follow, Resteem** [**@codingdefined**](https://steemit.com/@codingdefined)","created":"September 04, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Focus on your Goals like an Eagle","permlink":"focus-on-your-goals-like-an-eagle","previous":{"title":"Can art be expensive?","permlink":"can-art-be-expensive"},"next":{"title":"Contest #1â€”Win a Free Ticket to SteemFest 2017 at Lisbon!","permlink":"contest-1-win-a-free-ticket-to-steemfest-2017-at-lisbon"}}}}
