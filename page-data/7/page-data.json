According to WazirX :\n\n>Smart Token Fund is a simplified and never-done-before way to help you grow your cryptocurrency portfolio. STF's aim is to democratise cryptocurrency trading expertise for everyone. You can choose the right STF Trader for yourself based on the tokens they trade, their trading history, performance, and more. \n\nThe markets look like below, where there is a description of the coin and the latest price and how the trader is doing.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmekbtt5NAyQ5AVmEnWapAdzB9NEU5uzxgsuP4A3WDfJMm/image.png)\n\nI find it good because then I do not have to trade my crypto, there is someone who is doing it for me just like Mutual Fund Manager. But the same time you never know that you will be at loss or profit. In Mutual Funds there is some kind of stability or isk factor which will ascertain us that it is high risk or low risk. But here everything seems like High Risk itself.\n\nI have invested around 10$ just to see how it works and my portfolio is down a bit because of the recent blood bath in crypto space.

Do you know the pizza guy have to risk his life to get you the pizza on time. \n\nIt did happen in front of me today. I was going by my motorbike and saw a pizza delivery guy just overtook me, since it was raining an there was a traffic he has to apply brake which makes his motorbike skid and thus he fall. What if there was no traffic and he skids in the middle of the road and get hit by a truck. \n\nWhich actually made me realise that it's so hard for the pizza guys as they had to risk their life for delivering the pizza on time. Just take an example a guy has ordered a pizza for $10 and if that is not delivered on time it will be deducted from the delivery guy salary, that means around 2.5% of the guys income considering he earns around $400 a month.\n\nI do not support this free pizza culture even though it is late because if I have to get the pizza I will order little early rather than asking them to come before 30 minutes. I can say that 50% of my pizza delivery where above 30 minutes even though I have never asked for free pizza because I can pay for that pizza and it's a whole livelihood for the delivery guy.\n\nWhat do you think?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\",\"motivation\",\"blog\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"84776053-35cb-5cdb-9431-3e2b12cf0019","title":"On your product development team, which function is the most important player for setting product vision","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 19, 2019","permlink":"on-your-product-development-team-which-function-is-the-most-important-player-for-setting-product-vision","body":"#### On your product development team, which function is the most important player for setting product vision\n***\nI was going through the Linkedin, and found out this poll shared by Congnizant \r\n\r\n> Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services.

The best part of this festival was that you can buy different varieties of mango in cheap and also without worrying about the quality as the mangoes are organic and grown naturally. \n<hr>\nNote: The festival was from May 2019 to June 2019. \n<hr>\nIt was also a good knowledge session to know these many varieties of mangos because normally we came across 2-3 varieties of mango only. \n\n### Few facts:\n\n>1. Mango, the \"King of Fruits\" is an important fruit crop popular for its taste and nutritional benefits.\n>2. The fruit has its origin in Indo-Burma region.\n>3. In India about 40 varieties are commercially grown across various states in tropical, Sub-tropical and coastal areas.\n>4. Cultivated in an area of 25.16 lak hectares with production of 184.31 lak tonnes in India.\n\n![IMG_1333.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTLsYZyUNP4ZwhAvq3dtJt8T9ynz3S5hKz7UUsLQamEib)\n\nIn the above image, you can see Lal Muni, Nazuk Badam and Ostin.

There was no middleman involved which means all the money goes directly to the farmer and they will live happily for the rest of the year and prepare for the next year. \n\nSo if you happen to be in Bangalore in May or June next year, do plan to visit the Mango Festival and buy some tasty mangoes. \n\nBdw I got the box full of Mango this year :\n\n![IMG_1335.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaopawpW6z4EWXJg6GAJLnfVYLP1VfKqTfTgkxr5UbEue)\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"india\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\",\"palnet\",\"creativecoin\",\"photo\",\"travelfeed\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTLsYZyUNP4ZwhAvq3dtJt8T9ynz3S5hKz7UUsLQamEib\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qma5GJY4YzfVnwVdJ3MAxahCu8QYDTAAs21GYRZW1foMrM\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWvBokEBRdYVYnqJcr4TsRQk4V6ezrcZuaqeXtL3wVvzS\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmX65hJBdCu8ZXZLJfciM9kpD87ySucsPq7LSSVPY9RsDD\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmeKEKgUH5fkMYc7XGs4dCVLGzLuADZcwAuVcBHgw6SRnP\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUv5yy1MY7fDaqBofgy7c92bMieD8FUPZcQtAupKApR6L\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZvjX7HbYH7nF1sQwRLFF4TVrSTF2AS96NLkbtPgFzrrc\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaopawpW6z4EWXJg6GAJLnfVYLP1VfKqTfTgkxr5UbEue\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"011e3146-92bc-5efa-b2d3-0fb78707f9fa","title":"An Awesome Architecture","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 09, 2019","permlink":"an-awesome-architecture","body":"When we talk about architecture we often see all the new buildings which comes up everyday which makes us go feel wow.
