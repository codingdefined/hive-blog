There are quite a number of buses operate between Mysore and Bangalore which will charge you around 600 INR / 7$ for a one day trip to Mysore. But the problem with this type of trip operators is that they will give you limited time to explore the places and also they will take you to predefined places. \n\nThough if you are a budget traveller you can actually use these types of buses to visit important places in Mysore, but if you are travelling with a toddler it's better to keep some time in hand and explore the places at your own pace. This is what I have done. To keep my schedule less hectic I have taken a train to and from Bangalore to Mysore which comes 250 INR / 4$ to and fro. Since all the hotels have check-in at 12 PM, I have taken a train at 08:45 AM (MYSURU EXPRESS - 16316) which takes around 2 and a half hours from Bangalore. I have also pre-booked my hotel which came around 650 INR / 10$ since the discount was going on.\n\nI have started around 7:30 AM from my home, boarded the train and reached Mysore at 11:40 AM. You will get a lot of Tuk-Tuk from the railway station which will charge around 30-50 INR / less than 1$ to take you to the city centre. Since my hotel is very near to the Mysore Bus Stand, I paid the tuk-tuk guy around 50 Rs and he dropped me directly to the hotel. While my wife and kid were relaxing at the hotel, I have hired a Scooty from Bounce, which cost me around 500 INR + 200 INR for fuel / 10$, thus I don't have to pay those hefty amounts to tuk-tuk or taxis. \n\nWe have started around 12:15 PM from our hotel and reached [Mysore palace](https://steemit.com/india/@codingdefined/photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace). It took us close to 2 hours to complete the whole tour. As I have mentioned earlier that tour guys will give you only 1 hour to come back from Mysore Palace. So if you would like to explore, do take your time to view the artistic beauty of Mysore palace.  \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeKPiVCzZUkH6iPu4VEZYAfQEwhosmHPgDBGdg7h9Nbkj)\n\n\nAt 2:30 PM we had our lunch at the Veg Restaurant and then we went back to our hotel as my kid falls asleep. We again started from the hotel at around 5 PM to visit the Brindavan Gardens, we choose night time because there used to be a water fountain show at night. \n\n![IMG_1511.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmcfZ4sGSbTaNpYNRgYZJURkEgdCjMa82NP8sEZ3yEp4AL)\n\n![IMG_1528.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmb2gTv2MMHpPa31qiE9sGRunabgRaUM5BiLNSgkwsykSp)\n\nNot only that you will also to do boating around the lake. Please be informed that Brindavan Gardens also are known as KRSDAM or Krishnarajasagara Dam and very few people know it by Brindavan gardens. Also if you are using Google Map, it will take you to the back gate of Brindavan Gardens which remains closed so you need to ask people about the direction when you are around 2-3 KMs away from the Garden. At around 8 PM we have returned from Brindavan gardens and it took us around 40 minutes to reach Mysore, we had our dinner and we called it a day.\n\nWe have started Day 2 thinking where to visit first - Zoo or Chamundi Hills. We have settled it with Zoo because being a Sunday, Zoo might get crowded in the noon. The Zoo opens at 8:30 AM and we reached there by around 9:00 AM.\n\n![IMG_1643.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYHmZakQpHXtahEKovoso8C12s2UVEnqehpHAQpJNzQea)\n\nYou will see a lot of animals and it is one of the best Zoo I have visited, I can say it is much much better than Bannergatta National Park, Bangalore. My Kid enjoyed it and if you have a kid with you this is a must-visit. Also, note that the tour guys will not take you to the Zoo. \n\n![IMG_1566.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdXkjRE9kGYt8qSooer8gnKMzB7NzLPS21Q3FcT7ryzzQ)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1577.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmfQyec5tGTQBx5ayNp3wBQmo2RhumKTSu1zUBumBxvSaC)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1580.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPgbqwYejQh7SkburBFs7qVWdbWhGXPY1QHZrmQ5eczHG)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1591.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPt1TLU3MkYv1z2PwQSmhnckoyn47Sg6CXdC2YExHyheh)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1595.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUrbTe1EuTzCiBfK15RY5M942opqMF4BXx6ZHZDdd7JBL)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1608.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPwsBgMg7PqkRh3f3Y3rRseD8FaoL2VsxL8C9wt1H2u8F)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1633.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXUkhLNWeYUDQRKjp9CjvpR9X7XTaynSMQHDaqfWHifxb)\n\n<hr>\n\nIt took us around 3 hours to visit the whole Zoo and I must say we were tired like hell. We then went to Chamundi hills to visit the Chamundeshwari temple which is located at the top of the Chamundi Hills. Since there were too many people we have taken a ticket to get entry fast, I know its unethical but since we were having less time we need to take this route. You will love the greenery while going to the top of the hill and also you can view the whole of Mysore from the top. After reaching Mysore again we had our lunch, got our luggage and then dropped the vehicle and reached Mysore Railway Station. Our train was at 5 PM from Mysore and reached Bangalore around 8 PM.\n\nSo the cost involved are \n\n1. Travelling to and fro from Bangalore: 250 INR X 2\n2. Tuk-Tuk from Railway Station to Hotel - 50 INR\n3. Hotel - 650 INR\n4. Scooty - 700 INR\n5. Mysore palace Entry - 40 INR X 2\n6. Brindavan Gardens Entry - 15 INR X 2\n7. Mysore Zoo Entry - 60 INR X 2\n8. Chamundi Hills Ticket - 100 INR X 2\n9. Tuk-Tuk from Hotel to Railway Station - 50 INR\n10. Food - 1500 INR\n\nTotal - Around 4000 INR or 56 $. You can actually cut your cost more, like on food or Chamundi hills ticket. But for 2 people for 2-day travel to Mysore Rs. 4000 is OK.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travel\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"creativecoin\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"zzan\",\"travelphotography\",\"travelfeed\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/india\\/@codingdefined\\/photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmeKPiVCzZUkH6iPu4VEZYAfQEwhosmHPgDBGdg7h9Nbkj\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmcfZ4sGSbTaNpYNRgYZJURkEgdCjMa82NP8sEZ3yEp4AL\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmb2gTv2MMHpPa31qiE9sGRunabgRaUM5BiLNSgkwsykSp\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmYHmZakQpHXtahEKovoso8C12s2UVEnqehpHAQpJNzQea\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdXkjRE9kGYt8qSooer8gnKMzB7NzLPS21Q3FcT7ryzzQ\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmfQyec5tGTQBx5ayNp3wBQmo2RhumKTSu1zUBumBxvSaC\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPgbqwYejQh7SkburBFs7qVWdbWhGXPY1QHZrmQ5eczHG\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPt1TLU3MkYv1z2PwQSmhnckoyn47Sg6CXdC2YExHyheh\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUrbTe1EuTzCiBfK15RY5M942opqMF4BXx6ZHZDdd7JBL\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPwsBgMg7PqkRh3f3Y3rRseD8FaoL2VsxL8C9wt1H2u8F\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmXUkhLNWeYUDQRKjp9CjvpR9X7XTaynSMQHDaqfWHifxb\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"48b88360-93c7-5c33-8683-4c5bb835e2c2","title":"Photoristic Travel to Mysore Palace","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 01, 2019","permlink":"photoristic-travel-to-mysore-palace","body":"I might have shared a few photos of Mysore palace, but today lets go inside the Mysore Palace and see how beautiful it is from Inside as well as from outside.  So since Mysore Palace is #1 attraction in Mysore,  a lot of people tend to visit it and thus it remains crowded most of the time. If you want to take photos or do photoshoots inside you need to literally wait. \n\n![IMG_1434_01.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVQvVmz5B3victeWM4A9UgkmBaUmhSxCzEbKTuqyCEEjE)\n\nIt is just 2.5 km from the railway station, so you can reach Mysore palace from Railway Station by Auto, Car or even you can hire a bicycle.  Also, Mysore Palace is the venue for famous Mysore Dasara where you can see a large possession happening at this time of the year.\n\nThe architecture of the palace is a mix of Hindu, Muslim and Rajput styles which states that it is built on Unity between all the religions in India. The palace is also surrounded by a large garden thus you will find greenery too if you are planning to do photoshoot out there. The palace is also known as Amba Vilas Palace.\n\nThe palace can be reached from Four Arched Gates. The palace is made up of stone granite, pink marble and the main building of the palace is three stories. The general entry of the palace is from the South Gate. \n\n![IMG_1447.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaM44g5gVXnGYRJpLFcoZGDSBGNBQghik9SM6YxRwmig2)\n\nThis is known as the Kalyana Mantapa or Marriage Hall which is one of the first hall you sill see and I am sure it will surely leave you speechless. \n\n![IMG_1448.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPYEFQPVQAWNhj5cbqUMk1cUFJq7fmXU524xiZi4AZnst)\n\n![IMG_1451.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR6ZNP5bdG2YqRRHCtuujGdPWrFNCcL9rje2tYSSMXNq4)\n\nA Gate, though nothing to talk about it much we were not allowed to go inside of it.\n\n![IMG_1453.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRZCKGyddmAmKxwnnmrKUjLacwWoMATL2CJ4mgbzAj4on)\n\nThis is the area for a commonplace inside the Palace, which we can say a Private Darbaar of the King where he will do a recreational activity.\n\n![IMG_1460.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmfEnCbZ8v6qUKLqsorwM4FgDDQFci6wwbTmfN7jaYtDoz)\n\nFew more photos of Inside and Outside of Mysore Palace. \n\n![IMG_1465.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQBm9zgKVmS2Q6fBDzQwEeiuaztxxV7aUpeozgFv4e39d)\n\n![IMG_1470.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdTcE3SSuuCHeoXhZu2GWNTSFVs7QU69eQQtqqwmVCGzs)\n\n![IMG_1476.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVTprEecJ1VS79jmt4kcgEnPD1A5h3tWH8wCon4KrkUVA)\n\n![IMG_1485.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmb3XWeMpeuPdjjDHdgQy4EjkHUNbp2EeDS1Vs5HBcCnue)\n\n![IMG_1489.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR7pWdPFRVdY7JzeyPD6CDaZeAwRY4HbS2KrPMZL6Bohq)\n\n![IMG_1500_01.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmcz8o52zyKnAT9MoAeqcGa742LKhnozUF5Vet8teBcpAU)\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travel\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"creativecoin\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"zzan\",\"travelphotography\",\"travelfeed\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVQvVmz5B3victeWM4A9UgkmBaUmhSxCzEbKTuqyCEEjE\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaM44g5gVXnGYRJpLFcoZGDSBGNBQghik9SM6YxRwmig2\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmPYEFQPVQAWNhj5cbqUMk1cUFJq7fmXU524xiZi4AZnst\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmR6ZNP5bdG2YqRRHCtuujGdPWrFNCcL9rje2tYSSMXNq4\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmRZCKGyddmAmKxwnnmrKUjLacwWoMATL2CJ4mgbzAj4on\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmfEnCbZ8v6qUKLqsorwM4FgDDQFci6wwbTmfN7jaYtDoz\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmQBm9zgKVmS2Q6fBDzQwEeiuaztxxV7aUpeozgFv4e39d\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmdTcE3SSuuCHeoXhZu2GWNTSFVs7QU69eQQtqqwmVCGzs\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmVTprEecJ1VS79jmt4kcgEnPD1A5h3tWH8wCon4KrkUVA\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmb3XWeMpeuPdjjDHdgQy4EjkHUNbp2EeDS1Vs5HBcCnue\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmR7pWdPFRVdY7JzeyPD6CDaZeAwRY4HbS2KrPMZL6Bohq\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmcz8o52zyKnAT9MoAeqcGa742LKhnozUF5Vet8teBcpAU\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"4cef7c19-ab76-5bc0-a2ee-b7354c57a295","title":"Do you abandon your old dog?","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 28, 2019","permlink":"do-you-abandon-your-old-dog","body":"In India, we value our relationship too much be it blood relation or heart relation and it's very rare scenario that we abandon any one.

He was thinking of abandoning the dog and asking me if I know any fog shelter. I asked him simple question will he abandon his parents if they gets old. He said no, because they are his blood relation.\n\nWhich made me think that does people value relationship only if they have blood relation. I think that heart relation should be valued more than blood relation. And our relation with the dog just like any other heart relation or I think it's better than any other because they are totally dependent on us.\n\nCoincidentally I have seen today morning that an owner taking his old dog for a walk. The dog was not able to walk properly even though the owner patiently walking with him. I could not get a picture otherwise I would have sent it to my friend telling that this is how you should take care of your dog rather than abondoning it. \n\nDog are the most loyal pet, they will love you unconditionally and it return they just want a little love. My parents don't like dog so because of that I cannot keep a dog at home but I make sure I feed some dog in the street.
