Since we did not have a lot of  time to explore the city, we just decided to get a stroll around the famous chapel bridge .**\n\n**Luzern is a German speaking town in central Switzerland and it’s one of the top 10 most beautiful small cities in the world by Buzzfeed. It was okay for us , probably because we loved the Swiss country side more.**\n\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/is3vuu3gv/IMG_9336.jpg\nIt is  is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe.\n\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/n6gykf3f3/IMG_9314.jpg\n\nIt is a lovely place, there are some flowers along the bridge.
