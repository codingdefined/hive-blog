Or, at least, money can buy you extra free time and that may make you happier, according to a new study.\n\nThe research suggests that, instead of engaging in \"retail therapy\" in an attempt to feel better, people with enough money should spend it on paying someone else to do chores, such as cleaning, cooking, mowing the lawn, household maintenance or even shopping.\n\nOne of the researchers, Professor Elizabeth Dunn, said: \"Although buying time can serve as a buffer against the time pressures of daily life, few people are doing it even when they can afford it.\n\n\"Lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences.\" She added that the benefits of that extra time \"aren't just for wealthy people\".\n\n\"We thought the effects might only hold up for people with quite a bit of disposable income, but to our surprise, we found the same effects across the income spectrum,\" said Dunn, of British Columbia University in Canada.\n\nThe researchers surveyed more than 6,200 people in the US, Canada, Denmark and The Netherlands, asking them how they felt and how much they spent on time-saving services.\n\n\"Across samples, there was a significant interaction between time-saving purchases and time stress,\" they wrote in the journal 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'. \"Deconstructing this interaction, time stress was associated with lower life satisfaction among respondents who did not spend money on time-saving purchases.\n\n\"For respondents who spent money on time-saving purchases, the negative effect of time pressure on life satisfaction was not significant.\"\n\nAs part of the study, the researchers also gave $40 (approx. Rs 2,000) to 60 people in Vancouver to spend on a material purchase on one weekend and a time-saving service on another weekend. They found people were happier in the latter case.\n\nHowever, the survey found that many people did not seem to want to buy time-saving services even when they could easily afford them. Of some 818 Dutch millionaires included in the survey, nearly half said they \"spent no money outsourcing disliked tasks\".\n\n\"In recent decades, incomes have risen in many countries, potentially exacerbating a new form of poverty: from Germany to Korea to the US, people with higher incomes report greater time scarcity,\" the paper said.\n\n\"Feelings of time stress are in turn linked to lower well-being, including reduced happiness, increased anxiety, and insomnia... In theory, rising incomes could offer a way out of the 'time famine' of modern life, because wealth offers the opportunity to have more free time, such as by paying more to live closer to work.\"\n\nSource [Times Of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/money-can-actually-buy-you-happiness/articleshow/59766287.cms)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"money\",\"happiness\",\"india\",\"news\",\"life\"],\"links\":[\"http:\\/\\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\\/home\\/science\\/money-can-actually-buy-you-happiness\\/articleshow\\/59766287.cms\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"6100d312-0c92-50c6-a6e9-9d389681ad0c","title":"18 Years Ago India has won the Kargil War","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 26, 2017","permlink":"18-years-ago-india-has-won-the-kargil-war","body":"[]https://i.redd.it/bxldraw0qubz.jpg\n\nThe Kargil War (Hindi: ‡§ï‡§∞‡§ó‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß, kargil yuddh, Urdu: ⁄©ÿ±⁄ØŸÑ ÿ¨ŸÜ⁄Ø ‚Äé kargil jang), also known as the Kargil conflict,[note (I)] was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LOC). In India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (Hindi: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡§Ø, lit. \"Victory\") which was the name of the Indian operation to clear the Kargil sector.\n\nThe cause of the war was the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian side of the LOC, which serves as the de facto border between the two states. During the initial stages of the war, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Indian Army, later supported by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LOC infiltrated by the Pakistani troops and militants. Facing international diplomatic opposition, the Pakistani forces withdrew from the remaining Indian positions along the LOC.\n\nThe war is one of the most recent examples of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain, which posed significant logistical problems for the combating sides. It is one of the very few instances of direct, conventional warfare between nuclear states (i.e., those possessing nuclear weapons). India had conducted its first successful test in 1974; Pakistan, which had been developing its nuclear capability in secret since around the same time, conducted its first known tests in 1998, just two weeks after a second series of tests by India.\n\nSource [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"war\",\"peace\",\"won\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/i.redd.it\\/bxldraw0qubz.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Kargil_War\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"217935d9-e027-52eb-a69d-31771b5b22a4","title":"White Peocock - Bannerghatta National Park, India","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 25, 2017","permlink":"white-peocock-bannerghatta-national-park-india","body":"![20170723_164630.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQw5WqPAjZcJ8x5JmFRxsPwTxBKkHRFyH7ngrsic7Rmqx/20170723_164630.jpg)\n![20170723_164614.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNkyrZqpa2ksCsavnswsHP1mjuSdtm1nNZ5Jg6L8QSfSs/20170723_164614.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"animal\",\"nature\",\"animals\",\"steemitphotochallenge\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQw5WqPAjZcJ8x5JmFRxsPwTxBKkHRFyH7ngrsic7Rmqx\\/20170723_164630.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmNkyrZqpa2ksCsavnswsHP1mjuSdtm1nNZ5Jg6L8QSfSs\\/20170723_164614.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d512c9a6-7adb-51b2-8dc5-a4b7c563a42d","title":"Can't Stand Your BOSS?","author":"crowe","created":"July 25, 2017","permlink":"can-t-stand-your-boss","body":"It seems like every boss I have ever had has exerted this authoritarian rule over my life.
