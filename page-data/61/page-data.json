Or, at least, money can buy you extra free time and that may make you happier, according to a new study.\n\nThe research suggests that, instead of engaging in \"retail therapy\" in an attempt to feel better, people with enough money should spend it on paying someone else to do chores, such as cleaning, cooking, mowing the lawn, household maintenance or even shopping.\n\nOne of the researchers, Professor Elizabeth Dunn, said: \"Although buying time can serve as a buffer against the time pressures of daily life, few people are doing it even when they can afford it.\n\n\"Lots of research has shown that people benefit from buying their way into pleasant experiences, but our research suggests people should also consider buying their way out of unpleasant experiences.\" She added that the benefits of that extra time \"aren't just for wealthy people\".\n\n\"We thought the effects might only hold up for people with quite a bit of disposable income, but to our surprise, we found the same effects across the income spectrum,\" said Dunn, of British Columbia University in Canada.\n\nThe researchers surveyed more than 6,200 people in the US, Canada, Denmark and The Netherlands, asking them how they felt and how much they spent on time-saving services.\n\n\"Across samples, there was a significant interaction between time-saving purchases and time stress,\" they wrote in the journal 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'. \"Deconstructing this interaction, time stress was associated with lower life satisfaction among respondents who did not spend money on time-saving purchases.\n\n\"For respondents who spent money on time-saving purchases, the negative effect of time pressure on life satisfaction was not significant.\"\n\nAs part of the study, the researchers also gave $40 (approx. Rs 2,000) to 60 people in Vancouver to spend on a material purchase on one weekend and a time-saving service on another weekend. They found people were happier in the latter case.\n\nHowever, the survey found that many people did not seem to want to buy time-saving services even when they could easily afford them. Of some 818 Dutch millionaires included in the survey, nearly half said they \"spent no money outsourcing disliked tasks\".\n\n\"In recent decades, incomes have risen in many countries, potentially exacerbating a new form of poverty: from Germany to Korea to the US, people with higher incomes report greater time scarcity,\" the paper said.\n\n\"Feelings of time stress are in turn linked to lower well-being, including reduced happiness, increased anxiety, and insomnia... In theory, rising incomes could offer a way out of the 'time famine' of modern life, because wealth offers the opportunity to have more free time, such as by paying more to live closer to work.\"\n\nSource [Times Of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/money-can-actually-buy-you-happiness/articleshow/59766287.cms)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"money\",\"happiness\",\"india\",\"news\",\"life\"],\"links\":[\"http:\\/\\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\\/home\\/science\\/money-can-actually-buy-you-happiness\\/articleshow\\/59766287.cms\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"6100d312-0c92-50c6-a6e9-9d389681ad0c","title":"18 Years Ago India has won the Kargil War","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 26, 2017","permlink":"18-years-ago-india-has-won-the-kargil-war","body":"[]https://i.redd.it/bxldraw0qubz.jpg\n\nThe Kargil War (Hindi: करगिल युद्ध, kargil yuddh, Urdu: کرگل جنگ ‎ kargil jang), also known as the Kargil conflict,[note (I)] was an armed conflict between India and Pakistan that took place between May and July 1999 in the Kargil district of Kashmir and elsewhere along the Line of Control (LOC). In India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (Hindi: विजय, lit. \"Victory\") which was the name of the Indian operation to clear the Kargil sector.\n\nThe cause of the war was the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian side of the LOC, which serves as the de facto border between the two states. During the initial stages of the war, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Indian Army, later supported by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LOC infiltrated by the Pakistani troops and militants. Facing international diplomatic opposition, the Pakistani forces withdrew from the remaining Indian positions along the LOC.\n\nThe war is one of the most recent examples of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain, which posed significant logistical problems for the combating sides. It is one of the very few instances of direct, conventional warfare between nuclear states (i.e., those possessing nuclear weapons). India had conducted its first successful test in 1974; Pakistan, which had been developing its nuclear capability in secret since around the same time, conducted its first known tests in 1998, just two weeks after a second series of tests by India.\n\nSource [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"war\",\"peace\",\"won\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/i.redd.it\\/bxldraw0qubz.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Kargil_War\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"217935d9-e027-52eb-a69d-31771b5b22a4","title":"White Peocock - Bannerghatta National Park, India","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 25, 2017","permlink":"white-peocock-bannerghatta-national-park-india","body":"![20170723_164630.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQw5WqPAjZcJ8x5JmFRxsPwTxBKkHRFyH7ngrsic7Rmqx/20170723_164630.jpg)\n![20170723_164614.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNkyrZqpa2ksCsavnswsHP1mjuSdtm1nNZ5Jg6L8QSfSs/20170723_164614.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"animal\",\"nature\",\"animals\",\"steemitphotochallenge\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQw5WqPAjZcJ8x5JmFRxsPwTxBKkHRFyH7ngrsic7Rmqx\\/20170723_164630.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmNkyrZqpa2ksCsavnswsHP1mjuSdtm1nNZ5Jg6L8QSfSs\\/20170723_164614.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d512c9a6-7adb-51b2-8dc5-a4b7c563a42d","title":"Can't Stand Your BOSS?","author":"crowe","created":"July 25, 2017","permlink":"can-t-stand-your-boss","body":"It seems like every boss I have ever had has exerted this authoritarian rule over my life.

This has happened a few times, and its really getting old.   She plays a nice roll in front of others but then exerts this \"you will do this\" mentality all the time.  It seems like everytime I turn around she is there.  Getting tired.  I am really considering taking my own advise and quiting my job.  Life really is to short to be living under an oppression.

And for everyone else already on Steem, let's boost this growing popularity even more. \n\nThis post is about how to create the world we long for and how Steem and other cryptocurrencies can play a big part in this, why we should all try to boost Steem's growth with each of our posts as well as ways to incentivize such sharing so it becomes part of Steemians' second nature.     \n\nMost people who could benefit from using Steem haven't heard about it yet and it's a no-brainer for everyone  to work toward a better world helping remediate to this.  \n\n## Steem Pays Its Users! ##\n\nSteem is a revolutionary social network which pays its users for the votes, posts and comments they make depending on the votes they received. Not all votes are equal. \n\nI've made a lot of money Steeming in the last year, more than a hundred thousand dollars, but there's possibly very few people who can still expect to make many thousands solely blogging nowadays. \n\nSteem is the name of the technology and data base on which Steemit runs. Steemit is only one of the the many projects using this data base. [Busy.org](https://busy.org/) is another example, displaying the same information but differently. \n\nSteem is also the name of the currency users are being paid with. Each Steem are currently worth around [1,40$](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/#markets) and can easily be exchange for money. Steem is currently distributing around 63,000 Steem daily.\n\nNo credit card is required ever. The only thing needed to register is a valid email account. \n\nSteem details of its functionings can be found [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@teamsteem/steem-an-in-depth-overview). \n\nSign up [here](https://steemit.com/pick_account). \n\n## The Opportunity Of A Lifetime! \n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/07/18/20/27/sunrise-165094_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nWe're still very early and the opportunity to make interesting profits are very real. Steem currently has a bit more than 263,000 accounts.\n\nIt's somewhat getting increasingly harder to succeed but any success is also increasingly more rewarding as we go. \n\nAny posts or comments can pay their authors from mere pennies to hundreds of dollars and even though the trending page is filled with posts making hundreds of dollars, no new authors should expect their posts to make this much money even though it remains a possibility. \n\nMost trending posts are from established authors holding a lot of Steem and thus having a lot to lose or gain from the Steem price performance. Also, people holding a lot of Steem are leveraging them to receive more votes and thus bigger rewards. \n\nPosting anything will get their authors some rewards, from not quite a penny to much larger rewards as mention above. Posts can be a simple link or image or more extensive post. \n\nNew authors should probably stick to short posts requiring small amount of work and which are fun and witty, that is unless they know how to make their posts being paid well or if they are writing those posts with a precise objective which suits them. \n\n## Steem Popularity Is Skyrocketing! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2010/12/01/space-shuttle-774_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n  \nSteem is the most fun social network and its meteoric growth is a testament to that.\n\nSteem steemed from concept to reality in early 2016, to become the [3,673](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/steemit.com) most visiting website today and is still going up the rank at a frantic pace. \n\nCryptocurrencies are changing the way money is created, distributed and transacted and now Steem also change the way information is disseminated. Money \"rule\" the world and money creation rules money but that's a topic for another post. \n\nEvery 3 seconds new Steem are created and distributed by a network of computers which no single entity control. \n\nIf steemit.com were to close every Steemians would still have control of their funds and they could still access their exact same blog through other site like [busy.org](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiE6_DriJbVAhXDuhQKHcPRCzoQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusy.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNHRaFK-QAtRGOkZjASdIcd9PQ4FoA) or app like [eSteem](https://steemit.com/esteem/@good-karma/esteem-frequently-asked-questions-faq-eys44lmimx).\n\n## Hundreds Are Joining Everyday!\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/13/08/02/shaking-hands-2499612_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nHundreds of people are already joining Steem everyday, sometimes thousands and in a few months it could be tens of thousands. \n\nI know a lot of us wished we were making and publishing video when Youtube got launched back in early 2005. There wasn't a lot of competition back then and this would have been a good opportunity to build a valuable and fun business. \n\nThe same can be said about Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. People with a lot of followers on these websites are receiving advertising offers and some of them are getting well paid to post simple advertising links. \n\nSteem present even bigger opportunities than these websites and is still in its very early days. \n\nJoining emerging social networks very early can be very rewarding and Steem is no exception.  \n\n## Our Thoughts And Actions' Purpose ##\n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/08/22/26/meditation-2214532_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nThe very purpose of our thoughts and actions should be to create the world we long for and for this to happen, it's necessary to have our ideas shared by a growing number of people, therein lies the need to share our Steem posts far and wide as much as possible. \n\nSteem and all its users will gain immensely from accelerating Steem's growth. Steem content will get much more diversify, plenty and authors will feed on each others influence of ever more enlightening reflections. \n\nThe real value in each of our lives lie in the joy our actions and knowledge bring us rather than in any sorts of pseudo valuable we own, like national currencies. \n\nCooperation amplify our joy while its opposite, abuse, leads to mutual destruction. Let's work toward greater cooperation and curtailing abuse whenever possible. \n\nOur posts should also have a place left open to introduce people to what Steem is and what it can do for them. \n\n## Creating Beneficial Change! \n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/11/22/17/58/clasped-hands-541849_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nAs I've laid out above, reaching out to people is one of the most important thing in regard to creating the world we long for that's why I want to reward those who are doing it. \n\nMy 100% upvote is worth around 70$ and I have 10 of these every 24 hours. I don't necessarily plan on giving only 100% upvote but I would love to give at least one a day for the best outreach posts. \n\nFive days ago I said I would do such a thing for introduction posts. See [here](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me).  It turned out I gave 6 100% votes in a roughly 24 hours period. Here's the [list](https://steemit.com/almost-famous/@teamsteem/hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me#@teamsteem/re-teamsteem-hello-steemit-coinmaketcap-com-introduced-me-20170719t225913791z) of those posts. \n\nAny posts can be used to promote Steem, even introduction post. I will look for these posts promoting Steem in the tag #promoting-steem. \n\nNone of officially listed tags on Steemit are about promoting Steem. See [here](https://steemit.com/tags). \n\n## Creating The Culture We Long To Live From! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/02/01/15/orange-tree-1117420_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nLet's create a culture where it's in everyone's second nature to share their most useful knowledge and human power. \n\nSharing our posts as much as possible should be part of this. Promoting Steem can be easy and can make any already valuable posts even more valuable. \n\nIt's easier to create a good post promoting Steem than to make any other type of post.   \n\n## I Made Money On Steemit And So Can You!\n\nThere's so many people in dire need of money that money can always be used to attract attention but everyone should make sure to be honest though and clearly state that most people won't probably make as much money as the earliest adopters. \n\nNow no matter how much money people will make on average, Steem truly is a revolutionary technology and that's one of the reason why I want to share it far and wide as much as possible. I've already shared about all this throughout most of my posts. Here's one good [example](https://steemit.com/cooperation/@teamsteem/cooperation-is-humanity-s-greatest-asset). \n\nBy the way, a click-bait title is only a click-bait if the post isn't a useful post to the person who clicked on it. A title's purpose is to have people click on it and the intent of someone clicking on a link is to have a good time seeing what's behind that link. \n\n## Let's Reward Promoting Steem!\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/07/05/09/13/setting-2473874_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\n\n\nI will peruse the #promoting-steem tag. I invite others to join too. People should mention approximately how many people they will share their posts with, as well as provide links to these posts from their social media where they shared their posts. \n\nI use [Bitly.com](https://bitly.com/a/bitlinks) to share my links on other social networks. Bitly allow me to know how many people clicked on my links and also when. \n\nI have more than 200 clicks from Facebook's profile, on one of my [post](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan/posts/10159024444040471) I shared there last week. I also have more than [90 views](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/posts/1172186039593860) on the same post I share on one of my Facebook page. \n\nSteemit.com receive around [555k page views](http://www.hypestat.com/info/steemit.com) per day and around [14.4k Steem posts](https://steemdata.com/charts) are published every day. If everyone shared their posts and received only 10 clicks on them then that would result in a 25% increase in page views per day. From there, even more could be achieved.     \n\nIt's a given, Steem's already skyrocketing popularity would experience an epic boost if everyone would shared most of their Steem posts to their other social networks and that's why we should all make concerting efforts toward this goal.  \n\n# Boosting Steemit's Already Existing Buzz! \n\n<div class=\"pull-left\"><center><img src=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/22/19/15/audience-1850119_960_720.jpg\" /><br/><em></div>\n\nEach and every time people will hear about Steem should help generate create more interest.  \n\nTagging friends on Facebook and Twitter as well as adding tag there, will definitely helps your posts get more views.\n\nIf a lot of people begin to use the tag #promoting-steem then it might be a good idea to put the number of people the post is going to be shared with in the first line under the title's post like I did. \n\nThe number of people being reached out isn't the only thing I'll be looking in rewarding posts. I'll also be looking at the overall quality. \n\nI encourage everyone to help me incentivize this habit of doing as much as possible to boost Steem's growth. \n\nWhether or not this initiative will do much difference remains to be seen. It might or might not but I felt like trying.\n\n## Shared On ##\n\n- Facebook Profile: ([760](https://www.facebook.com/guillaumecardinalvegan))\n- Facebook Page: ([204 followers](https://www.facebook.com/Guillaumecardinal8/))\n- Twitter: ([600](https://twitter.com/TeamSteemLive)) \n- Instragram: (I'll be using it in the future)\n \n## I'd Love To Change The World!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1URj5VJl_JE\n\nThank you to @papa-pepper for the awesome t-shirt! \n\n## Thank You!\n\nThank you for reading and for commenting!
