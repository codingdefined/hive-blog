Promises are to keep, but I am breaking them, just to break the silence. </b>\n\n<b>Unfortunately last week one of my best friends mom passed away and a couple of days thereafter also my grandmom. Very unfortunate events, especially my friend's mom (too young) which naturally shifts priorities for the last & coming couple of days.</b>\n\nHowever, my family was actually very kind and considered my already planned trip in regards to planning the cremation ceremony of my grandmom, thus as I am writing this I am sitting in a plane from Amsterdam to Lisbon. The coming days (until friday) I am in the city to meet about 15 (potential) locations and suppliers for the SteemFest² program.\n\nNot long  after I return I will be able to finalise all locations and have a budget overview so I know what the minimum ticketprice will be for the event and can launch the site & ticketsale. In the meantime @cass (yeah!) has already offered to make a new look & feel to align SteemFest² with Lisbon's characteristics.\n\nRest assured that I will do my utmost best to make the event (again) as inclusive as possible, by having a not-for-profit ticketprice. This is mainly possible thanks to sponsorships of (for now) mostly fellow Steemians and Steemit.inc!\n\n<h4>State of the Sponsorships</h4>\nLast year I only started sponsorship requests after most of the program was booked & reserved. This year however I felt with the _\"June Bull Boom of the Cryptos\"_ that it would be smart to reach out for support during that period as it would be easier for people and also relatively 'cheap' to support with some Steem.\n\nSofar, the following people have supported the @SteemFest account and make your ticketprice of SteemFest² (way!) lower than the costprice per person:\n- @abit\n- @arhag\n- @blocktrades\n- @pharesim\n- @riverhead\n- @smooth\n- @wackou\n\n<b>Thank you very much guys!</b>\n\nAny additional sponsorship is very welcome, just donate to @SteemFest account for bigger personal donations and/or you can also support the @t-r-f account which is the Travel Reimbursement Fund, a generic fund which will pay out to SteemFest² attendees who apply (in Lisbon) for a travel support payout.\n\nFYI, Still want to sponsor some, but not in the big league? No problems... Wait for the ticketshop to open! Just like last year the ticket pricing will come in several 'support levels', so if Steem was good for you the past year, you are free to buy a more 'expensive' support ticket (which will still be lower than the costprice) which helps making the event great again!\n\n<h4>Great community initiatives on the way!</h4>\n- @jesta fwd'd comment_rewards from his wonderful @chainbb project to @steemfest\n- @joseph gave away 2 (!) all expenses paid trips to Lisbon!\n- @theprophet0 is gave away an airplane ticket as well!\n- @richardcrill's SteemFest Dreams initiative is going strong with a winner elected\n- Many people supported the @t-r-f Travel Reimbursement Fund so far: @knozaki2015 @ausbitbank @firepower @mariandavp @lichtblick @skapaneas @hitmeasap @kevinwong @ericvancewalton @walterj @edb @blueorgy @benjojo. If you want to know more about how the Travel Reimbursement Fund will work, and how payouts will be calculated, check the blogposts on @t-r-f account. \n@kyriacos is going bezerks with all these fancy designs as well :) \n\nFor now, I'm signing off, and going to the taxi to my first meeting with the bus/coach/shuttle company and then I'm heading to HF Fenix Music as it has the swimmingpool on the roof and continue to meetings throughout the coming days.\n\nBy the way.... did you already book a hotelroom in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemfest/@roelandp/steemfest-updates-hotel-s-booking-site-now-available\" target=\"_blank\">official SteemFest² HF Hotels</a>?
