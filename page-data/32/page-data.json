Other things you will learn is\n\n- Basic File and Code Structure of Gatsby\n- Importing packages\n- How to Create Component and Use it in other file\n- How to Create Link from One File to Another\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Node.js and NPM installed on your System\n- Know basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though not mandatory\n\n#### Difficulty\n\nBasic\n\n#### Tutorial Contents\n\nRecently I have started exploring React which is one of the hottest technology in the market right now. One of the reason of learning is then I can contribute more on teh bugs in Utopian, as my knowledge is limited in React. So I have tried to create a simple project using create-react-app npm package but somehow that is not working on my system. I was looking for alternative and found out that Gatsby is one of the alternatives of it. The only issue with Gatsby is that it only used for Static Site Generator. I thought of giving it a try since it might be a new thing to learn.\n\nThe advantages of Gatsby includes its fastness, you need not have to think about Webpack (React thing) because its build inside the gatsby itself, easily integrated with APIs and Database.\n\nSo Let's Get Started with Basics of Gatsby\n\nInstallation : Installation can be done from npm using the command `npm install --global gatsby-cli` which will install your gatsby globally. Once done you can start your new Gatsby project by writing gatsby new gatsby-site. Once done you need to go inside gatsby-site directory and type gatsby develop which will open the development browser at localhost:8000 as shown below\n\n![gatsby1.PNG](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516105171/zfs1z0rf4q2makyzjlvr.png)\n\nOur Directory Struvture looks like below where all the code resides in src folder. Layout is the main folder where we have the layout of the entire site. It contains index.js file which is nothing but a starting point of your React Application as shown below\n\n![gatsby2.PNG](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516105435/f1x6hsbmruw8ofeqxjny.png)\n\n###### layout>index.js\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516105907/q3ykobkw2c0fcos2ew8k.png)\n\nNow if you are new to React like me its better to go each and every line and see what it does. The first five lines is just for importing all the files or packages we will need in this file. We will come to that file usage when we reach that info. Next we are creating a const variable which has some code written inside it. One thing to note here is that React uses JSX that means it combines your HTML with JavaScript and tightly coupled them. TemplateWrapper is nothing but a React Component which holds the layout of the Gatsby application. \n\nJust with the start we are using Helmet component(imported as react-helmet) which is used to attach all the header meta information like description, keywords to your generated HTML file thus known as document head manager for React, you can get more information here https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet.\n\nNext we are attaching the Header component inside the TemplateWrapper using <Header /> whose code can be found under components > Header > index.js (which will take a look later). We are also styling our page inside the template itslef so that it remains inside it if we are using this component anywhere else too. One more thing to note here that you need to invoke the function (children ()) within the Component itself so that it know where all the HTML files to be inserted.\n\nNext is to export the TemplateWrapper so that any other file can use it as a component. As I said before we will go through the header component as well. So Header Component Looks like below :\n\n###### component>header>index.js\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516105987/u8uuyfrrfnhyhm7tjhyv.png)\n\nSame like TemplateWrapper you need to first import all the required package and then create the component having HTML and Javascript as well as CSS. One think to note here that we are using one more component called Link (gatsby-link) which is a package by gatsby to easily create links inside the component itself which will take the URL structures you are using. Now our structure is Done with the Template having Header and Layout. Next thing is to create the pages. The main page looks like below \n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516106031/pyur8rcxhth57mh23l0e.png)\n\nWhere we have a component named IndexPage containing JSX temnplate code and then we are exporting it. If you see closely we are also creating a link which will go to Page-2 where the page 2 looks like below :\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516106058/kpswnljj9v4bhhieuhur.png)\n\nYou can both the files looks similar in implementation having different wordings. This way you get started with Gatsby Static Site Generator. In our next post we will extend our work on creating a Simple Static Website.\n\nNote : I need to attach pictures of the Code as Code Formating Not Working Properly\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-1\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"utopian\",\"app\":\"utopian\\/1.0.0\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"repository\":{\"id\":36040894,\"name\":\"gatsby\",\"full_name\":\"gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"html_url\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"fork\":false,\"owner\":{\"login\":\"gatsbyjs\"}},\"pullRequests\":[],\"platform\":\"github\",\"type\":\"tutorials\",\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"steemdev\",\"tutorial\",\"programming\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105171\\/zfs1z0rf4q2makyzjlvr.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105435\\/f1x6hsbmruw8ofeqxjny.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105907\\/q3ykobkw2c0fcos2ew8k.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105987\\/u8uuyfrrfnhyhm7tjhyv.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516106031\\/pyur8rcxhth57mh23l0e.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516106058\\/kpswnljj9v4bhhieuhur.png\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105171\\/zfs1z0rf4q2makyzjlvr.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105435\\/f1x6hsbmruw8ofeqxjny.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105907\\/q3ykobkw2c0fcos2ew8k.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516105987\\/u8uuyfrrfnhyhm7tjhyv.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516106031\\/pyur8rcxhth57mh23l0e.png\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1516106058\\/kpswnljj9v4bhhieuhur.png\"],\"moderator\":{\"account\":\"vladimir-simovic\",\"time\":\"2018-01-16T16:02:39.055Z\",\"reviewed\":true,\"pending\":false,\"flagged\":false}}"}},{"node":{"id":"270fcdd4-2a8e-5dbb-9337-0d969ce8f161","title":"Color Challenge - Tuesday Orange - Orange Fish","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 16, 2018","permlink":"color-challenge-tuesday-orange-orange-fish","body":"Today I am sharing few photos of two Orange Fish (might be golden in color).
