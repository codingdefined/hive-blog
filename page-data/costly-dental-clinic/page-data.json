But whatever I came to my senses or say that I came to know that your dental problems can be costly.\n\nSo, I was suffering from bleeding gums. It was not happening regularly but whenever my brush completes the 2 months mark, my gums bleed. I always try to change my brush every 3 months. Bleeding gums being a common problem happens for a lot of reason.\n\nSo to know the reason and the remedy I visited the dental hospital. The clinic was really great means the interior. I was actually amazed to see the interiors as well as how well maintained it was.\n\n![61yk79svw8.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/61yk79svw8.jpg)\n\n<hr />\n\n![vem9s354yg.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/vem9s354yg.jpg)\n\nThe doctor suggested me to with gum therapy and that will cost me around $150/ Rs 10000. So that was costly for me, I thought it would be something around 30$ / Rs 2000 but I was wrong, bangalore is really costly. So I dropped the plan to get for gum therapy in Bangalore, and will go for the therapy in Kolkata which is somewhat less costlier than Bangalore.\n\n ","created":"October 11, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Costly Dental Clinic","permlink":"costly-dental-clinic","previous":{"title":"Hacktoberfest - Have you signed up?","permlink":"hacktoberfest-have-you-signed-up"},"next":{"title":"Aren't we too tied with Technology","permlink":"aren-t-we-too-tied-with-technology"}}}}
