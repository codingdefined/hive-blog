Delicious #70 : Virgil's real BBQ at Atlantis!","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\n![IMG_0s261.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNu6z5ou9CFUPDkKzNFk8hpRrpWxkXHDHPXUFBTH645zg/IMG_0s261.jpg)\n\nContinuing our exploration of the culinary delights of Atlantis, today we'll be having a look at one of the most scenic restaurants in Atlantis. Sure it doesn't have the same high end thematic feel of [Poseidons Table](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-68-poseidon-s-table-a-restaurant-worthy-of-gods), nor is it by the gorgeous ocean like [Blue Sail Restaurant](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-66-the-infamous-blue-sail-beach-restaurant) but with the backdrop of the Atlantis defining *Royal Towers*, ***Virgils BBQ*** is definitely one of the most visually pleasant places to eat in Atlantis.\n\nSituated just a minutes walk away from the [Lagoon Bar & Grill](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-75-saying-hello-to-sharks-stingrays-sawfish-at-the-predator-lagoon-photos-video) - also the home of the *Predator Lagoon*, ***Virgils BBQ*** is surrounded by some of the best attractions in Atlantis, offering diners a true visual treat.\n\n\n![virgils.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaSLQjK49qg96C93awZgHgpb7Qnt14Pg375yPmR6C6YqK/virgils.png)\n\n***Virgils BBQ*** prides itself as a top 10 BBQ restaurant originating from the USA. \n\nIn 1993, the first *Virgils BBQ* opened in Times Square. The vision of its founder, *Artie Cutler* was to serve authentic southern barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket and pork.  Today, it has restaurants in Las Vegas and now in Atlantis, Bahamas!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LepRfvh.gif\n\nA quick look around and you can see this restaurant is surrounded by sheer tropic splendour. Palm trees and dense vegetation everywhere you look. A real sense of paradise, borrowed from the magnificent setting that is the Atlantis resort.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/e9QeaF/IMG_0257.jpg\n\nAs this was an afternoon lunch visit, most diners have opted to sit on the outside terrace. Shallow lagoons line one side of the terrace with Stingrays swimming freely below.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fy1KaF/IMG_0259.jpg\n\nOn the other side, we have a perfect view of the Royal Towers. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/j3Vbpa/DSC01848.jpg\n\nThis is one of the open kitchens doubling up as an open bar. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/e6HBNv/IMG_0263.jpg\n\nYou can also choose to sit inside where you have a perfect view of the *Stingray lagoon*.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jLhp9a/DSC01849.jpg\n\nAs you can see, it is a very spacious restaurant with some lovely semi enclosed tables serving as shade from the sun and also a little bit of privacy.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nB4EaF/DSC01850.jpg\n\nThe bar is very spacious and holds up as a perfect gathering place for some drinks as well as delicious barbecue food. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/etO7vF/DSC01852.jpg\n\nGuests will have the option to sit outside on the terrace, in the main court, or on these high tables.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ngzfFF/DSC01851.jpg\n\nI was told that their kitchen uses actual firewood to barbecue the meat. No wonder they have piles of wood ready to use on the side.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/evwhUa/DSC01863.jpg\n\nAll around the top of the centre court, are names of places in the South of the US. This reflect's the style of food which they serve - Southern Barbecue!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iYJzaF/IMG_0258.jpg\n\nAs nice as the inside of the restaurant is, the front side had such beautiful views of the Paradise Lagoon and the Royal Towers. I decided to sit outside in the sun after feeling a bit lonely inside. (There was literally no other guests inside)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gnKmpa/IMG_8522.jpg\n\nAs you can see from the map below, ***Virgils BBQ*** has certainly done their research and have collected all the various southern style bbq's and integrated them into their own product. I never knew that the taste of the meat could differ so much depending on how you smoke the meat, and which type of wood oak was used.  \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/exY7vF/IMG_8519.jpg\n\nBelow is the *Patio Lunch Menu*, there are also happy hour deals for those dining at the slightly awkward hours of 3pm-8pm.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iDxBNv/IMG_8520.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kLG5hv/IMG_8521.jpg\n\nBy now you must have realised that I am a big fan of salad and vegetables in general! So we begin with a small serving of side salad.  Fresh, with chunky cucumber and cherry tomatoes, a perfect light refreshing start!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ireEaF/IMG_8525.jpg\n\nNext up, we have the *Garlic Shrimp*. Usually shrimp on a stick tends to taste a little water logged, masked by the taste of the sauce. Not these shrimp! They are full of oceanic flavour, probably caught on the same day. In China, shrimp is always kept live in water tanks right up to the point they are cooked. These shrimp taste comparatively fresh so that's a very big yes in approval from me! 👍\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hik99a/IMG_8526.jpg\n\nNext up, the ***Pulled Chicken Sandwich***. In China, we have a similar dish except with pulled pork in a white softer bun. This BBQ version tasted a little tougher, but the chicken has absorbed the bbq sauce really thoroughly making the burger bun a necessary balance to the quite strong sweet and slightly spicy taste. I've never had chips served on the side of a burger / sandwich before, usually just Fries. It's a welcome surprise anyway!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cj8U9a/IMG_8529.jpg\n\nIt's hard to believe how scenic the patio is. The Royal Towers in full view, and green / blue everywhere you look!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fAN32v/IMG_0256.jpg\n\nFinally, the main course and the *\"meat\"* of the meal. ***Kansas Special***. They labelled this as a *PIG-OUT* and for good reason. The platter has Ribs, wings, trash ribs and brisket! Basically all of the Virgin BBQ specialities all in one platter!\n\nOne thing I really appreciate about the BBQ meats is how little BBQ sauce was used. I don't have to get my fingers too dirty and the sauces never overwhelm the strong oak wood smoked taste etched into the meat.  \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/g1AFhv/IMG_8536.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/m9xNUa/IMG_8531.jpg\n\nOne thing I can say about the restaurant aside from it's really delicious BBQ food, is the restaurant staff are incredibly friendly and willing to answer any questions about everything to do with Bahamas. *De Angeli* who is the girl in the picture with me was super nice and we had a nice eye opening chat about life in Bahamas and what it's like to be a local there. I really wanted to have my picture taken with her and I even told her to sign up to Steemit. I hope she sees this and we can reconnect!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/g8Ku9a/IMG_0260.jpg\n\n***Virgin BBQ*** is a lovely restaurant for those craving some genuine southern style BBQ meat. It's location is probably it's greatest asset, views of the Royal Towers are sublime from the patio, and the shallow Stingray lagoon surrounding part of the restaurant give it that extra bit of exotic tropical life!\n\n\n<hr>\n\nHope you enjoyed my post!
