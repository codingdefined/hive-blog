Faith is the belief you keep on yourself to become your own role model. People all over the world use symbols or representative for worship, be it river, structure, book, idols or even charms. These are the center's of faith which benefit the believers by fulfilling their desires.\n\nNow the question is, how come some people prayers are answered whereas others it's not. This is where the faith come into picture. This is just like a physical science where faith gives you desired result by the power of your soul. In Hindi it's called Atma-Shakti or inner power. The science I am talking about is the Newton third law where every action has its equal reaction, just like if you throw a ball against a wall it will rebound with equal force.\n\nWhen you pray with your full power, your faith along with the force of soul strikes with the force to your believed object and rebound back as a desired results. Now we must understand that to fulfill that results not only your faith but your action should also go hand in hand. There is a saying in India that God help those people who wants to help themselves. If you have the faith, but do not have a inner strength to the work then you will not get the desired results.\n\n> A Quote : The reason birds can fly and we can't is simple because they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings.
