Promotion, because they want people to know about their product so that people can buy it. Most of the times these promotions target their competitors, i.e. instead of showing their qualities, they try to find the negatives in other products. \n\nThese type of products or people cannot succeed because instead of finding faults in your product if you find fault in other products, how do you know that what is the shortcomings in your product. Whenever I go to buy any product and if the person compares that product with other products and tell me the negative of that product, I will make sure I will never buy a product from that place, because he is not telling me the good things about his product and that's what I want to know. \n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfX7dRkZDkWmnmwGZ4ybqSptARqNfV2iCgxU9jJQ7AwXE/image.png)</center>\nPC : https://www.maxpixel.net/Positive-High-Thumb-Plus-Down-Negative-Opposites-489521\n\nRecently there was a new MotorBike Launch in India i.e. Bajaj Dominor which has a lot of good qualities and have a lot to offer.

But this approach has a shortcoming that if the user list has to be updated we have to release a new version of the extension.\n\n### Subsequent Release\n\nIn the subsequent releases, I have been working to find out how to give the managers of SteemStem the option of editing the user list. I used Google Sheet, but somehow the values are not getting updated in the extension. Creating a service will be an overhead.\n\n### Last Release\n\nI thought of creating a GitHub Repo which will serve as an API where we will keep the json file of all the user list. In the chrome extension we have to use XMLHttpRequest class to retrieve them. The problem arose here is that XMLHttpRequest  can be called regularly only in background.js and the values of that should be passed to contentscript.js. For that I have to use chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener in the background.js and chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener in the contentscript for message passing.\n\n### The Stats of SteemStem Extension in Chrome\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfSakLvu1eSoj8rVDNhM9WTGXhshexyNpixKxJy2WKzX7/image.png)\n\nChrome Extension Download Link : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stemassistant/bbaobeefambibhbkifjaogcpmjfcihef\nMozilla Firefox Add On Download Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stemassistant/","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemit\",\"steemstem\",\"steemdev\",\"programming\",\"development\"],\"users\":[\"mobbs\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmfSakLvu1eSoj8rVDNhM9WTGXhshexyNpixKxJy2WKzX7\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/steemit\\/@mobbs\\/introducing-stem-assistant-no-more-wasting-vp-on-science-content-thieves\",\"https:\\/\\/chrome.google.com\\/webstore\\/detail\\/stemassistant\\/bbaobeefambibhbkifjaogcpmjfcihef\",\"https:\\/\\/addons.mozilla.org\\/en-US\\/firefox\\/addon\\/stemassistant\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"c0a7adc4-2b8e-55e9-b862-15491cf19944","title":"Join the @blocktrades World Cup | 2,000 SBD in Prizes!","author":"worldcup-russia","created":"May 31, 2018","permlink":"join-the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-2-000-sbd-in-prizes","body":"### <center>No kidding: a 2,000 SBD prize pool and ANYONE who can make a post, can join in the fun!</center><hr>\n\n<center>In only 14 days the biggest sports event in the world will begin: <b>The Football World Cup celebrated in Russia</b>.</center>\n\n<center>https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/04/23/17/08/football-3344911_960_720.png</center>\n<center><sub><sub>[Source](https://talksport.com/football/russia-world-cup-2018-fixtures-dates-kick-off-time-stadium-group-stage-match)</sub></sub></center>\n\n<div class=\"text-justify\">@blocktrades loves to sponsor this type of community engaging projects and @acidyo & @anomadsoul know a lot of Steemians love this game, so we decided to organize this enormous Football World Cup event.<hr>\n\nYou don´t have to be a professional analyst of the game, your national team doesn´t have to participate, you don´t need to know much about Football to join...</div>\n\nAll you need to do is write a post picking every match winner and, the Steemian who makes the most points, wins. \n\n## <center>As simple as that</center>\n\n#### <center>Hey @acidyo, I want a piece of those 2,000 SBD, how do I join?

Now there are quite a few checks you have to do before giving the result back. \n\nIn the task request, it is specifically mentioned that that \"Parse the text and compare it with a set of regular expressions\", thus instead of easy split functions we should use REGEX. So lets find out how to approach this Task Request.\n\nFirst Of All, in the task request it is clearly mentioned that always it starts with \"@utopian-bot !utopian\", that means we have some starting point. Now using the Regex Expression we will check if the input test starts with @utopian-bot !utopian or not.\n\nI use https://regex101.com/ to check all my regex because it gives a clear explanation how my Regex Expression worked. Now since I know that my input will start with @utopian-bot !utopian I will start my regex with @utopian-bot !utopian* which means match everything which starts with \"@utopian-bot !utopian\". Next is to get the value after \"@utopian-bot !utopian\" which can be done using the Regex `@utopian-bot !utopian *([^\\n]*)`. The Explanation from https://regex101.com/ is \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTLYwgaEEkFz6VygQddaaPxPkYCGj6YLc7arNsFCCUubA/image.png)\n\n`([^\\n]*)` means get all the characters from the single line and then add it as a group. Thus we will get blank or the beneficiaries i.e. [], or '@mention1 @mention2 @mention3 @mention4' or  '@mention1:15% @mention2:35% @mention3:25% @mention4:25%'. \n\nOur Next Part is to get the mention and the appropriate weight of that mentions which can be done using the regex `(\\w+(?::)(\\d+)?) ` which is creating groups of mention:weight as shown below\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfWSUnnSMxZroCZd9oTAykfEbQv5poVzcykNEoPWUmWT8/image.png)\n\n`\\w+` matches any word character \n`:` matches the character : literally (case sensitive)\n`\\d+` matches a digit (equal to [0-9])\n\nNow after that you will get a group, thus you have to loop through it and send the mention and weight in the beneficiary. This is a how you approach for the similar Task Request in teh future.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"programming\",\"steemdev\",\"javascript\",\"tutorial\"],\"users\":[\"utopian-bot\",\"mention1\",\"mention2\",\"mention3\",\"mention4\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmTLYwgaEEkFz6VygQddaaPxPkYCGj6YLc7arNsFCCUubA\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmfWSUnnSMxZroCZd9oTAykfEbQv5poVzcykNEoPWUmWT8\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/utopian-io\\/@utopian.tasks\\/js-developers-and-regex-experts-wanted-javascript-coding-task\",\"https:\\/\\/regex101.com\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"60f1a34e-63a5-513e-81a3-f2e9c6758e48","title":"Street Photography - Kodaikanal - Happy Face","author":"codingdefined","created":"May 24, 2018","permlink":"street-photography-kodaikanal-happy-face","body":"Street Photography - Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India.
