But this approach has a shortcoming that if the user list has to be updated we have to release a new version of the extension.\n\n### Subsequent Release\n\nIn the subsequent releases, I have been working to find out how to give the managers of SteemStem the option of editing the user list. I used Google Sheet, but somehow the values are not getting updated in the extension. Creating a service will be an overhead.\n\n### Last Release\n\nI thought of creating a GitHub Repo which will serve as an API where we will keep the json file of all the user list. In the chrome extension we have to use XMLHttpRequest class to retrieve them. The problem arose here is that XMLHttpRequest  can be called regularly only in background.js and the values of that should be passed to contentscript.js. For that I have to use chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener in the background.js and chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener in the contentscript for message passing.\n\n### The Stats of SteemStem Extension in Chrome\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfSakLvu1eSoj8rVDNhM9WTGXhshexyNpixKxJy2WKzX7/image.png)\n\nChrome Extension Download Link : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stemassistant/bbaobeefambibhbkifjaogcpmjfcihef\nMozilla Firefox Add On Download Link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stemassistant/","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemit\",\"steemstem\",\"steemdev\",\"programming\",\"development\"],\"users\":[\"mobbs\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmfSakLvu1eSoj8rVDNhM9WTGXhshexyNpixKxJy2WKzX7\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/steemit\\/@mobbs\\/introducing-stem-assistant-no-more-wasting-vp-on-science-content-thieves\",\"https:\\/\\/chrome.google.com\\/webstore\\/detail\\/stemassistant\\/bbaobeefambibhbkifjaogcpmjfcihef\",\"https:\\/\\/addons.mozilla.org\\/en-US\\/firefox\\/addon\\/stemassistant\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"c0a7adc4-2b8e-55e9-b862-15491cf19944","title":"Join the @blocktrades World Cup | 2,000 SBD in Prizes!","author":"worldcup-russia","created":"May 31, 2018","permlink":"join-the-blocktrades-world-cup-or-2-000-sbd-in-prizes","body":"### <center>No kidding: a 2,000 SBD prize pool and ANYONE who can make a post, can join in the fun!</center><hr>\n\n<center>In only 14 days the biggest sports event in the world will begin: <b>The Football World Cup celebrated in Russia</b>.</center>\n\n<center>https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/04/23/17/08/football-3344911_960_720.png</center>\n<center><sub><sub>[Source](https://talksport.com/football/russia-world-cup-2018-fixtures-dates-kick-off-time-stadium-group-stage-match)</sub></sub></center>\n\n<div class=\"text-justify\">@blocktrades loves to sponsor this type of community engaging projects and @acidyo & @anomadsoul know a lot of Steemians love this game, so we decided to organize this enormous Football World Cup event.<hr>\n\nYou don´t have to be a professional analyst of the game, your national team doesn´t have to participate, you don´t need to know much about Football to join...</div>\n\nAll you need to do is write a post picking every match winner and, the Steemian who makes the most points, wins. \n\n## <center>As simple as that</center>\n\n#### <center>Hey @acidyo, I want a piece of those 2,000 SBD, how do I join?
