The main motivation for me to become a Utopian Moderator is that I can see a lot of stuff happening on the Open Source and can filter out the best one out of those.\n\nProfessionally I am a Software Developer having 5.5 years of experience. All my years I have coded in ASP.NET but I know other languages too like Node.js, R, Angular etc. I have also fixed few bugs in Utopian and improved the Search feature of the same. I have knowledge of SOLR search engine and Jenkins (Continous Integration and Deployment Software). \n\nI know Hindi, Bengali, English, and learning Kannada. \n\nI have created BidBot which is a Discord Bot to check Price and Get the Latest, Hot, Trending Posts with the help of @reggaemuffin. I have two NPM packages which includes cryptoticker(Cryptocurrency Price Checker) and pincode(Gets Pincode info of Indian Cities). I have also created a Discord Upvote Bot for The Steem Engine Community.\n\nI also have a website http://www.codingdefined.com where I share tutorials of what I am learning currently and also if any bug I encountered (along with solution).\n\n<center>https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/845349626894925824/kW4_3tR6.jpg</center>","created":"January 12, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Utopian Moderator Intro - CodingDefined","permlink":"utopian-moderator-intro-codingdefined","previous":{"title":"[Colourfulphotography] Celebration in a Temple","permlink":"colourfulphotography-celebration-in-a-temple"},"next":{"title":"Trees on both side of the Road","permlink":"trees-on-both-side-of-the-road"}}}}
