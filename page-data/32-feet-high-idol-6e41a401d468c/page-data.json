I had heard a lot about Hanuman Idol but never went there. So today I decided to utilize my time and visit the temple.\n\nThough it was not far away but trusting Google Maps was my biggest mistake, it shows temple which is like 29 kms away but in reality it was only 13 kms. Though because of that I have ride more than 60 kms.\n\nNever mind it was a happy ending as I got to see the idol and spent quality time in the temple. The best thing about temple or any worship place is that your mind and body get relaxed, and you feel energetic.\n\nFront side of the temple. The idol is 32 feet high and it's carved out of single granite stone, which is awesome to see.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/ru7fu3n2i5.jpg)\n\nThe idol.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/n9k9gjtss9.jpg)\n\n### Camera: Nokia 6","created":"November 10, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"32 Feet High Idol","permlink":"32-feet-high-idol-6e41a401d468c","previous":{"title":"MacroPhotography - White Flowers","permlink":"macrophotography-white-flowers"},"next":{"title":"Beautiful Looking flowers","permlink":"beautiful-looking-flowers-1028587994e9a"}}}}
