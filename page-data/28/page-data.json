Healthy not only means that you should have a physique like a bodybuilder or you should have a six-pack. Healthy means that you are happy both physically and mentally. Mentally happy means that you have a positive attitude on any aspects of your life because that can give you the power to cope up with that situation whereas physical happiness means that you are happy with the way you are and will not think what others think about you but you.\n\nNow coming back to the topic how 5 small changes I try to make in my life to live a better life.\n\n1. Wake up early and have a morning walk - From this month I have started waking up at 6 AM which was previously 8 AM which gives me enough time to have 1 hour of walking. One thing I noticed by going for a morning walk is that your perspective on life changes drastically. You get a positive energy which helps you to overcome the present scenario you are in.\n\n2. Try to eat more Home Cooked Meal - We all love to eat out and try all the new restaurants nearby but that not only helps you to gain weight but also empties your pocket. I am also a foodie but still, I started to have 1 or 2 meal a day at home which is helping me big time.\n \n3. Spend more on healthy food than the expensive clothes - I rarely eat fruits thinking it to be an expensive item in our daily life, but as a famous saying \"An Apple a day keeps the doctor away\" is apt at any given day. You need to have as much fiber or healthy elements in your daily food habits thus started to change my perspective to eat fruits more.\n\n4. Read at least 30 minutes - Read motivational articles or good books every day (not only trending posts in Steemit) for at least 30 minutes which changes your perspective of seeing the world.\n\n5. Have a passion - So recently I have started a passion for clicking photos, a little photographer in me. I can tell you that I love taking photos not only because nature or world is beautiful but that helps me to change my focus to something I like. How much time you dedicate yourself in a day, not even 5 minutes. But keeping a passion gives you a \"me\" time which we all need it.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"writing\",\"india\",\"health\",\"life\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a57cc430-646a-5082-8ea1-fb2addc33305","title":"TrueUSD started trading in Bittrex, is it the end of Tether?","author":"codingdefined","created":"March 06, 2018","permlink":"trueusd-started-trading-in-bittrex-is-it-the-end-of-tether","body":"So today TrueUSD started trading in Bittrex which is claimed to be a price stable cryptocurrency which means each 1 TrueUSD will be redeemable for 1 US Dollar.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPfF1YRPYR4v4ucpr3Axkzf31Cx6EwmtiMoyLy1vyetfK/image.png)\n\nTo withdraw TUSD to USD you need to send the TUSD to an escrow agents or trust agents who will wire the USD to your account and the TrueUSD coins are burned.

Likewise we will have a package.json file which will have the information about your Plugin along with the dependencies. \n\nFor Example a typical package.json looks like below where you have the name, version, description, scripts if any, author, license and the dependencies. The dependencies are nothing but all the details of the packages I am using for this Plugin.\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"gatsby-source-myplugin\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"description\": \"My Source Plugin\",\n  \"main\": \"gatsby-node.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Coding Defined <codingdefined@gmail.com> (http://www.codingdefined.com)\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"utopian-api\": \"^0.4.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see above I main file as gatsby-node.js where all teh code for this plugin will be going. Here we will have two main Nodes \n\na. sourceNodes, \nb. createNode\n\n1 - You will be exporting the sourceNodes, so that any Gatsby app calling your plugin can consume it. So your gatsby-node.js will start with something like below.\n\n```\nexports.sourceNodes = async ({ boundActionCreators }) => {\n    return;\n};\n```\n\n2 - Now the createNode is used to create a new node which will have below properties\n\n- id - The id of the node\n- parent - The id of the parent node\n- children - Its an array which contains id of all teh children node\n- internal - Internal is an object where we have mediaType, type, content, and contentDigest. MediaType gives a sense to the transformer plugin (if used) that the content can be transformed or not. Type is used to query all the posts for the plugin in GraphQL. Content is the content of the node and contentDigest is the digest for the content.\n\nSo since we know about sourceNodes and createNode it will be dead simple to create your Gatsby Source Plugin. Lets create a single node first, for example if I get a post which has id and the content, what I am going to do is to write a createNode function and add parent, children, internal to it as shown below. \n\n```\ncreateNode({\n  ...post,\n  id: `${post.id}`,\n  parent: \"root\",\n  children: [],\n  internal: {\n    type: 'MyPost',\n    content: nodeStr,\n    contentDigest: nodeHash,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe \"post\" in teh first line is the full post, id is the id of the post. Since I do not need any parent for this post I will assign \"root\", children also is empty. The type of the post is \"MyPost\" that means if I use GraphiQL I can use it as AllMyPost to get all the nodes. Now content is the post itself, for that I first stringify the post as shown below, and assign the nodeStr to the content.\n\n`const nodeStr = JSON.stringify(post);`\n\nNext is to specify the digest for the content using contentDigest. For that first we have to have crypto in your file using `const crypto = require('crypto');`. Next we will be creating a md5 hash and then update the nodeStr (i.e. the stringify post of ours) with it and then create a digest in hex as shown below\n\n```\nconst nodeHash = crypto\n     .createHash('md5')\n     .update(nodeStr)\n     .digest('hex');\n```\n\nLets say we get 10 posts as an array of object so we will be going through it one by one and then creating the node for each one of them as shown below\n\n```\nposts.forEach(post => {\n  const nodeStr = JSON.stringify(post);\n  const nodeHash = crypto\n    .createHash('md5')\n    .update(nodeStr)\n    .digest('hex');\n\n  createNode({\n   ...post,\n     id: `${post.id}`,\n     parent: \"root\",\n     children: [],\n     internal: {\n       type: 'MyPost',\n       content: nodeStr,\n       contentDigest: nodeHash,\n     },\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNow the full code should be inside our sourceNodes, thus our full code looks like below\n\n```\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\n\nexports.sourceNodes = async ({ boundActionCreators }) => {\n  const { createNode } = boundActionCreators;\n  return posts.forEach(post => {\n           const nodeStr = JSON.stringify(post);\n           const nodeHash = crypto\n                   .createHash('md5')\n                   .update(nodeStr)\n                   .digest('hex');\n\n           createNode({\n             ...post,\n             id: `${post.id}`,\n             parent: \"root\",\n             children: [],\n             internal: {\n                type: 'MyPost',\n                content: nodeStr,\n                contentDigest: nodeHash,\n             },\n           });\n  });\n};\n```\n\n##### How to Use that Plugin in Your Application\n\nAt first we need to add our newly constructed plugin in the gatsby-config.js file as shown below\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [{resolve: 'gatsby-source-myplugin'}],\n};\n```\n\nAnd then to get the data to our app, we need to add a qraphQl query as shown bwlow\n\n```\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query IndexQuery {\n      allMyPost {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            id\n          }\n        }\n      }\n  }\n`;\n```\n\nAnd next is to use it, where we are iterating over the data and get the id of the node\n\n```\n{data.allMyPost.edges.map(({ node }) => (\n  <div>\n    {node.id}\n  </div>\n))}\n```\n\n\n### Curriculum\n\n- [Getting Started With Gatsby.js - Part 1](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-1)\n- [Getting Started With Gatsby.js - Part 2](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-2)\n- [Getting Started With Gatsby.js - Part 3](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-3)\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-4\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"utopian\",\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"repository\":{\"id\":36040894,\"name\":\"gatsby\",\"full_name\":\"gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"html_url\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"fork\":false,\"owner\":{\"login\":\"gatsbyjs\"}},\"pullRequests\":[],\"platform\":\"github\",\"type\":\"tutorials\",\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"steemdev\",\"tutorial\",\"programming\",\"coding\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/utopian.io\\/utopian-io\\/@codingdefined\\/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-1\",\"https:\\/\\/utopian.io\\/utopian-io\\/@codingdefined\\/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-2\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/utopian-io\\/@codingdefined\\/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-3\",\"https:\\/\\/utopian.io\\/utopian-io\\/@codingdefined\\/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-4\"],\"moderator\":{\"account\":\"laxam\",\"time\":\"2018-03-01T12:51:16.255Z\",\"reviewed\":true,\"pending\":false,\"flagged\":false},\"questions\":[],\"score\":0}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":270,"numPages":75,"currentPage":28}}}
