As the STEEM price consolidates and declines a little so does the user base.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUaqSDrQcLSqiKKe2eaGk9zSjeukUpoGtdbLtftjPbrbS/image.png)\n\nIts because most users like to visit the site on Wednesdays every week... I wonder what's up with that?\n-\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPjp71Pz2owoEBd6r16N7BShEHsMJD5r5c1Mrro4xBH1S/image.png)\n\nThe last couple of Weeks the US and South Korea have been swapping places.\n-\nIt's interesting to see India in 4th place and Indonesia in 6th. \n-\nIt's interesting to also note the respective positions of:\n-\n- Nigeria, Venezuela in 10 and 11th\n- Philippines, Japan in 14 and 15th\n- Mexico, South Africa and Ukraine in 18,19 and 20th\n- China and Brazil are also making a push forward.\n\nThose are just the movers I notice, How is your country doing?(edit: the numbers in these columns are sessions not users)\n-\n\n\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTFAzs5E6gapK8kuKRYMX2MrAynuzU3oFbnbV98SCoNPk/image.png)\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmW8eNVWUxj8ikBXUvqS9RGYNutzCHJkTqJgZ2NSc1okud/image.png)\n\nNow for the biggest surprise of them all... Check out the top three cities.\n-\n\nSeoul - South Korea\n-\nMedan - Indonesia\n-\nLagos - Nigeria\n-\n\nMedan and Lagos have just squeezed past the incumbents, London and New York  (edit: the numbers in these columns are sessions not users)\n-\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf7qZjUo3rhdxefF4pUkkGWVQ5ntJf6kSMDUUZQeninRR/image.png)\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmV1KRAyWgsGz45SHX5CND8jfbc3FbiMVtmGjrgYGhDeXN/image.png)\n\nHow's your city doing? is it on the list?\n-","created":"July 21, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A look back in time to where we are now.","permlink":"a-look-back-in-time-to-where-we-are-now","previous":{"title":"Follow Friday: People I disagree with","permlink":"follow-friday-people-i-disagree-with"},"next":{"title":"Weekly Steem Stats Report - July 24, 2017","permlink":"weekly-steem-stats-report-july-24-2017"}}}}
