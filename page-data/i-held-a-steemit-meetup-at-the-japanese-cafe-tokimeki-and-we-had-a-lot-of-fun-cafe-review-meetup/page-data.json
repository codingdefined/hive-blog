(Cafe Review + Meetup)","body":"**Three Japanese women entrepreneurs own this beautiful little cafe, \"Japanese Cafe Tokimeki\" in my hometown Mangalore, India. I first met them when they had a small outlet at one of the popular malls in town. Sisters Akiko Tokunaga and Yuko Tokunaga with their close friend and partner Haruka Ninomiya came to India in 2015.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MOmNqdq.jpg\n<center><sup></sup></center>\n\nThey initially landed at Chennai based on the recommendation of a friend, but eventually visited Mangalore. They loved my city and decided to set up something here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cFwbPTZ.jpg\n\nAfter a year of running a small unit  at the local mall, a year ago they decided to open up a proper Cafe and I've been a regular customer ever since. Overtime they became my friends and I try and support their cafe whenever I can. We're all BIG fans of Japanese anime especially Dragon Ball Z, and I also happen to like the Japanese culture very much. In fact my friends have started calling me the brand ambassador of Cafe Tokimeki! \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iPX9nah.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/y7ZAKn4.jpg\n\nRecently, I was planning on a follow-up to the #1 India Steemit Accelerator and felt this was the best place for a meetup. It's small, cozy and comfy and everyone loves a good laugh here as we tend be very jovial patrons when we get together. I also felt this is a great opportunity to share some details about this wonderful cafe with our community here. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YSZAXJF.jpg\n<center><sup>The whole spread!</sup></center>\n\n> Tokimeki as per my understanding means excitement in Japanese. \n\nThe food is absolutely delicious and I've got a few photos and captions to help you understand what they were. @srinidhi managed to have a spoonful of Wasabi which blew his mind! There are some funny pictures at the end. The food got over in no time, and we pretty much emptied the stock of Maki rolls in the restaurant.\n\n**Tokimeki is the best place to go for Japanese food in Mangalore and the next closest place is over 380 kms away in Bangalore city.** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YX6xJ7W.jpg\n\n**As you can tell in the following pictures we loved the items on the menu and we ate a LOT!** \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/drp5dEg.jpg\n<center><sup>Anko Toast - A little sweet and very delish item.

But many were travelling at the time so only a few showed up. It was good to regroup and discuss our individual progress on the platform and I'm happy to inform that my accelerator event helped these users understand the platform better.\n\nI also got a few ideas for the upcoming Bangalore event. It's good to see the Steemit community make a difference to the lives of many people across the world. \n\n### Because Meme Is Love, Meme Is Life! \n\nAs a group of friends we are quite funny and we all love memes so @speedracer dished out a few from the event and I hope you like them! \n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/oGOjVZ4.jpg</center>\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HxlvdsN.jpg\n<center><sup>Join Steemit if not the Wolverine will strike!</sup></center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/h797Aj5.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/zm95L64.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/9g3Mhtl.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/cBT6f6u.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/NsqPZNK.jpg</center>\n\n<center>http://i.imgur.com/JrX8g9w.jpg</center>\n<center><sup>Social Media Generation be Like!</sup></center>\n\n\n\n**If you live in Mangalore or are travelling through this city then this cafe is a must visit!** \n\nUntil next time, Sayonara folks! \n\n----------\n \n\n**If you like my work kindly resteem it to your friends.
