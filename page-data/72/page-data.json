Let's look at the story of Steem and Zcash for guidance.  More than a year after release, Steem is a proven investment with low risk and high reward today because of the odds of a price increase and the ability to participate on Steemit which has hundreds of thousands of users and makes thousands in payments to authors every day.\n\n**When was the best time to buy into Steem?**  A year ago Steem had potential but no proven results.  Today buying Steem is much safer especially for the casual buyer because the odds of a reward just from holding Steem are higher and the risks of a price drop are lower given the data presented later.  For the enthusiastic all in buyer, investing steadily over the last year would have been ideal and also would leave little time or energy to invest in anything else!  It also might have been tempting during the down times to sell out and jump in with something else only to miss out on the biggest opportunities for growth!\n\n**How did Zcash perform after a huge initial release the first year?**  Zcash came out with a huge initial price spike followed by an epic drop from $4239 for 1 Zcash to as low as under $30 within a year.  What a wild ride that would not be fun if the only goal was to make money!\n\n**How are Steem and Zcash a mirror for EOS, IOTA, and most any initial coin offering?**  What journey can a buyer of EOS or IOTA expected based on what those buying Steem and Zcash faced during the first year?  Would we take a look together either by continuing to read or watching the video below because it might save us a lot of time and money?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZtkHZj-7gY\n\n**Located in the USA?**  EOS does not make the tokens available for sale to buyers in the United States because of the following legal terms listed at https://eos.io/faq.html.\n\n\"17. **Why canâ€™t U.S. citizens, residents or entities purchase EOS Tokens?**  It was decided that U.S. citizens, residents and entities should be excluded from purchasing EOS Tokens in the token distribution because of some of the logistical challenges associated with differing regulations in the many states of the United States of America. block.one does not believe that the distribution of EOS Tokens or the EOS Tokens themselves are securities, commodities, swaps on either securities or commodities, or similar financial instruments. The EOS Tokens are not designed for investment or speculative purposes and should not be considered as a type of investment. Nevertheless, U.S. citizens, residents and entities should not purchase or attempt to purchase EOS Tokens.\"\n\nSeeing that EOS was not available in the USA unless I bought on Bitfinex or another exchange made **deciding not to invest in EOS** simple for me and motivated further research into why I already have been avoiding buying into new cryptocurrency ICOs?\n\nFirst, will we **look at risk** because famous investor *Warren Buffett's number one rule of investing is \"Never lose money\"*? Does buying into an ICO or a cryptocurrency at least one year after release provide a much lower risk?  Yes because with over a year of data on a proven currency, we can easily look back to get an idea of whether the price today is low, high, or about right.  When a new digital currency is launched, we have no reference point to see how low the price was when no one wanted to buy and how high it got when the excitement was maximum.  Clearly buying in during the initial coin offering is a huge risk because how can we determine if the value is accurate on a cryptocurrency that just launched?\n\nSecond, will we look at a comparison with investing in startups because initial coin offerings are a very close comparison to angel investing or venture capital investments in a new startup company?  When funding startups with capital, the loss rate is huge with investors expecting to make a profit on small percentage of total investments which hopefully will cover losses.  Venture capital firms often are lucky to pick 1 out of 4 winners with 75% companies they invest in not even providing the initial investment back and only maybe 1 out of 200 being a really high return.  With initial coin offerings, the rate of success is likely to be similar because like a startup company just beginning to get to work, there is a lot of hope and promise of changing the world with few proven results.  In talking to most people, it is easy to see how almost everyone has amazing ideas that change the world while very few of those ideas are actually executed with most failing fast.\n\nThird, will we review the data for our own community here in Steem because the trajectory for EOS is likely to be the same?  Here is the first month or so of the price of Steem a year ago now.  Naturally if we have just bought Steem the entire time from release until launch and participated in the community the whole way, we might have a fortune by now.  If we are so excited about a new cryptocurrency we are ready to commit everything to it right away, then yes buying some to begin with and every day going forward might make sense.  However, is this honestly the approach we are looking to take on most ICOs or are we really hoping to use them to make money?\n\n![Steem Release to July 2016.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVg1omJs1ucMzAN6HzbYizmPCXy1qwiNtYEdSi47o3a5r/Steem%20Release%20to%20July%202016.jpg)\n\nIf we were hoping just to make some money on the Steem ICO we might have bought in within the first day or so of release according to CoinMarketCap.com at around $0.89.  Over the next month we might have been a bit disappointed at the price consistently dropping and landing at around $0.20 which would have been about a 75% loss depending on exactly when buying and then selling.  Many investors at this point would have sold and considered it a loss because we are programmed to buy high when everyone is excited and sell low when fear takes over.  What happened next?\n\n![Steem Price April 2016 to July 2017.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXPziaN8Zfc9aZVs7pxqnc9R92nyHsGAtPLpDpCXJMVPj/Steem%20Price%20April%202016%20to%20July%202017.jpg)\n\nWho would have believed then in July 2016 the Steem price would take off to as much as $4 for one Steem?  If we had bought in at the very first opportunity and sold at the height of excitement, we might have make 4x our money if we were just purely looking to use Steem to get a return on investment and if we had made it through the price drop of the month before.  At the same time, why sell at 4x when it might go to 10x or 20x or 100x?  How many of us really would have sold at $4 after seeing the price go up so fast?  Wouldn't we have held on for even greater profits?\n\n![Steem all time to July 2017.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaQiU5hnkyk2eVkPcP9gf1hGvMYYf3QPWM5wq5ipRK24W/Steem%20all%20time%20to%20July%202017.jpg)\n\nAfter hitting $4, the Steem price still a year later has not returned to $4.  Now how much fun does it sound to invest in an ICO where the price of Steem today has been a roller coaster since it was first available?  If we signed up FOR THE RIDE, we would have had a blast!  Here is a review of the Steem ride.  At launch the price was close to $1 and over a year later now up about 50% with the high never more than 4 times the initial investment and the low down as much as 90%!  That's a ride we might get sick on if signing up just for a nice profit!  If we bought in when the hype was the greatest at over $2, our investment still would not even be in the positive yet a year later and would have at one point been nearly a total loss.\n\nThe point is that now Steem is an outstanding investment because it has proven itself in good times and bad.  Now the risk is much lower to buy some Steem today because we can see that today with the price being $1.80 it is probably a good buy given that it was over $4 at one point, albeit with a lot less Steem available, and with a year of growth since the highest price the true value is likely much higher than ever before.  While the price could go down some or even a lot as a part of a bigger market catastrophe, we know here that we have real value because of how much we have contributed in posts and relationships which are visible to everyone.  Steem is no longer a startup but rather a self-sustaining business.  Most startups never make it to this phase which is why self-sustaining businesses tend to draw the greatest investments.\n\nAfter considering Steem, how about EOS?  So far EOS according to their website has only released about 20% of the supply they are planning to within the next year.  That means for every one EOS token available today there will be 4 more given out within the next year which is likely to mean a big price decline.  Within the first month of release might be the very worst time to buy in especially on an exchange which is how the prices are determined and where likely a relatively small amount of EOS is available relative to the total.  The actual price most have paid for EOS is likely a fraction of what the exchanges say meaning the market cap is almost completely imaginary without actual figures of ETH received by EOS.\n\nWhat makes buying in worse is that how much given to the buyer each day is relative to how much ETH is sent in.  Some days a lot of Ethereum being sent in might mean buying at above market price while on a few days of low demand a great deal might be possible.  If we are set on buying EOS, buying in every day is likely to produce the best result because the distributions are based on demand and low demand days make great payouts.  The problem is that every day more tokens are given out likely means more sellers trying to cash out on exchanges.  Buying on exchange now is almost certain to end up in a loss as the greater profits made initially the more users will try to put more for sale which will drive the price down as the initial euphoria of release wears off and gives way to being one of 500+ cryptocurrencies which needs a lot of contributions to be meaningful.\n\nOn top of these existing issues, if the Ethereum price takes a dive, it also will be cheaper to buy more ETH and change it to EOS.  Naturally the opposite is true if it goes up although this is likely to be balanced by how much ETH is sent each day to the initial distribution.  While today it seems like the safest and smartest option to wait until EOS has delivered proven value to hundreds of thousands of users over the next year, what about other initial coin offerings?\n\n**When we review the Zcash ICO, this will get even better!**\n\n![zcash release price chat.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWwJMZjehvAVnCVyJNfNY6rzgMZXSwkQiZD4drjpsmvMN/zcash%20release%20price%20chat.jpg)\n\nYes the number is displaying correctly on the chart above!  The initial price for 1 Zcash was $4239 at release with speculative markets pricing at over 2,000 in BTC for 1 Zcash or ZEC.  The ZEC market cap at the time was over 1 billion dollars which is more than double what it is today despite many more Zcash available.  All of the hype over how amazing EOS is reminds me of the same with Zcash which was supposed to be replacing Bitcoin a year ago.  On July 4, 2017 the price for that same exact Zcash less than a year later is $295 even after a recent huge growth in price.  At the lowest, ZEC went below $30 just a few months ago.  Again, buying in at the beginning would have resulted within a year in a nearly total loss.  A year after release Zcash is number 12 on the market capitalization charts and seems unlikely to compete with Ethereum or replace Bitcoin in the foreseeable future.  That said, Zcash is in a great position to continue making a meaningful contribution to our financial revolution online going forward and we are grateful it exists!\n\n**Our problem tends to be thinking we are smarter than other people.**  We think we invest better than others.  We think we make better love than others.  We think we are better bosses and employees than others.  We think we lead better lives than others.  The truth is that we are all so similar we are practically clones of each other with a few basic different models having small differences similar to Battlestar Galactica.  We are all so much smarter than each other we predictably get lured into the same traps over and over again only to be complaining to our same friends over and over again about how the same thing happened to us again and we cannot believe we forgot and it will never happen again.\n\n**Initial Coin Offerings are usually a trap** like Leia tried to warn Luke Skywalker about in The Empire Strikes back which despite being the second star wars movie released is Episode V.  Like Luke, we might lose our right hand financially as the dark lord of the currency reveals himself to be our father.  While some humor is attempted here, the message is clear.  **It is better to wait and let every new cryptocurrency prove itself before making a significant investment.**\n\n**What about having an ICO like EOS as part of a sexy term like diversified portfolio?**  One author yesterday explained that not having a diversified portfolio was insane because we could lose everything if that one investment falls through.  While this is certainly true, maybe just having one partner and one job is insane also because if we get fired or our partner leaves us, we lose everything for the moment.  Then in the next moment we have the opportunity to begin fresh with a new job, partner, or investment.\n\n**What experience do I have with buying in early?**\n\nI bought into Steem as part of a diversified portfolio on Poloniex for about 0.1 BTC which was around $100 at the top of the hype along with 20 or 30 other altcoins.  Over the next several months while many of my altcoin investments went up, Steem took a big dive.  When my 0.1 Bitcoin of Steem became worth 0.01 Bitcoin, I bought another 0.1 BTC of Steem figuring it would have to go back up at some point right?  When it kept dropping along with the rest of the altcoin market in December 2016, I sold it all and left thinking \"Steem is worthless\" because for me it had been the way I used it.  I then bet everything on Dash based on a lot of hype from my friend @aarellanes when he was working with @robertgenito after I heard about masternodes and Wall of Coins putting Dash as the second currency on their website after Bitcoin.  After contributing a massive amount of hype to Dash, I then sold out 4 months after buying in and now here I am all in on Steem so far 2 months in!\n\nAfter months of passively trading on Poloniex up until December 2016, I discovered the great joy of actually getting something out of my investment in the form of being a member of a community.  Up until then, I had simply thought that the point of investing was to use money to make more money.  I completely missed out on the point of investing being to do some good in the world by combining the contribution of money with service in the form of participation.  Fortunately for Steem, the Dash community was like a pair of underwear that were too tight for me which cut off circulation to things important for me being able to reproduce.  Sure it would keep me warm but at what cost?\n\nWhen I invested in Steem, it was a fairly safe investment because with a year since the initial release, it was easy to see the value of the existing community and to make an assessment of the true price of Steem relative to the actual price.  I calculated Steem was undervalued as much as 10 times relative to other currencies and that my service within the Steemit community would be valued above most other places I could go.\n\nInvesting in Steem posed little risk because after a year of ups and downs, a lot of real improvement took place while the total value of the combined Steem tokens was lower than it had been before.  All of the Steem today a year after the initial hype in July 2016 is worth about the same as it was then.  Therefore, this makes for a great investment because the true value of Steem is was higher than it was a year ago because of all the participation and improvements.\n\nBeing a courageous soldier willing to run up to the front lines and risk everything looks great in movies and is great if we are willing to contribute that much to our cause.  Buying into an ICO without completely participating in the investment by making a significant contribution on an ongoing basis is just like going into a casino and throwing some money down and hoping to win.  I have done that enough times to hopefully have learned my lesson that I have no business going into a casino unless I am hoping to give them my money.  I even invested as much as $1,000 in a presale once and have no plans to do that again either because I only have so much time and energy to contribute.\n\n**An ideal investing experience includes the opportunity to exert some influence on the return of the investment which is why I love Steem**.  Here each of us can personally make a contribution to the ongoing value of our investment by posting, upvoting, commenting, and sharing Steemit with friends and family.  When I read Money Master The Game by Tony Robbins, the one key investing strategy I noticed that Warren Buffet and other top investors in the world seem to do is to invest where they personally can make a difference.  If we can personally make a difference in an ICO, then by all means invest and get to work!\n\nThe reality is most of us have very limited time and energy while trying to prove to the world the opposite is true by showing how much we can do and telling everyone how busy we are.  I have time to do a really good job contributing to one cryptocurrency just as I have time to do what I hope is a really good job of contributing to one family with one wife.  While it might put me less at risk of losing everything to find a few more cryptocurrencies to invest in and a few more wives to raise families with, the reality is the more diversified I am, the less I do well.\n\nIn dating this was very obvious as I could barely keep the names of the girls I dated straight when it got to more than three at once.  After an initial euphoria of feeling like I was a god for having two girls over in one night, the uncomfortable reality set in of confusing who said what and trying to keep everyone happen.  Fairly quickly all the girls would find a guy that would give them a better answer for \"Where is this going?\" than answering their question with another question like \"Where is what going?\"\n\nFor cryptocurrencies this took much longer to learn because I did not ask any of them to marry me.  Why not trade 50 different currencies?  Would I have bought Steem in the beginning if I knew more about it?  Probably not because just to hold it on an exchange was an awful idea before the December 2016 change reducing inflation.  *Today I am grateful I learned enough to be here and to finally settle down into being of service consistently in one place instead of trying to hop each day from one exciting new crypto partner to another the next day.*\n\n*Thank you very much for reading all the way to the end of this post** which took me two hours to type this morning after I woke up at 5:30 am and felt compelled to write about this to help us avoid both the losses and the fear of missing out!

An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key.**\n\nWhile this seems obvious, some fail to grasp it. You can use this private key to import your _Ethereum Wallet_ into most _Ethereum Wallet Clients_. _Always do plenty of research on a wallet before you drop a private key into it and make sure it's secure and is void of vulnerabilities. Crypto is about [Personal Responsibility](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds), and nothing myself or anyone says should ever supplement it. This is **NOT** a claim that MEW is free of vulnerabilities, that is for you to decide_. \n\nThe process is usually relatively easy, because after all, **_an Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key_.** As the title implies, this guide is focused on importing into MyEtherWallet (These steps can be extrapolated to Parity/GETH CLI, Ethereum-Wallet, MIST and Ethereum Web Wallet as well, but I have not found any guides... _hint hint_)\n\n**Your best bet** is probably to never expose your private key, ever, choose a wallet and stick with it or even better, use cold storage or offline tx signing. However, these are not always feasible for more advanced operations like interacting with a contract on Ethereum Mainnet. And sometimes, this might be your only option.\n\nThe problems with MetaMask have been observed while aiding people with [EOS Crowdsale](http://eos.io). Whether it was a DDoS, or slow nodes, it quickly became obvious that interacting with the contract directly through Ethereum-Wallet or MyEtherWallet may be more accessible for **advanced users.**\n\n# Protect yourself\nIt's probably not a great idea to use the online version of MyEtherWallet for high value wallets. If you are dealing with a high value wallet, you should educate yourself about Offline Signatures with MEW. The \"most secure\" way, is to have an offline computer that is never connected to the internet where you handle your private keys. You can then sign a transaction from that computer, and with the generated QR code broadcast the transaction from an internet enabled device. This is referred to as \"Air Gapping.\" It's recommended that you research these principles to protect yourself against the unthinkable. Otherwise, consider a less convenient and user friendly route, like Parity. You can never be too safe. \n\n# Understand the risks\n**An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key.** It's dangerous to move private keys, so dangerous, that most wallets go through great lengths to encrypt them and make them inaccessible to reduce their attack vector. Here's only a few of the ways these unencrypted keys to your wallet could be compromised:\n- Accidentally paste them somewhere public, like a chat\n- Compromised system or wallet client software.\n- Accidentally pasting and appending to a URL in an address bar and then hitting the server consequently creating the possibility that they are in a server log\n- Falling for a phishing site, like [this one](https://steemit.com/mew/@sandwich/alert-myetherwallet-phishing-site)\n- Compromised server hosting MyEtherWallet. If the server hosting MyEtherWallet were compromised, you could subsequently compromise your key. \n- Social hack on MyEtherWallet's hosting company could result in DNS resolution to an attackers server, like with what happened to **Classic Ethereum Wallet**\n- _A handful of other ways..._\n\n_BTW... If any of these ever happens to you, your wallet is burned, and it's time to move all assets from your burned wallet to a newly generated or another existing Ethereum wallet quickly._\n\n# Disclaimer\n**THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

To ensure this, we've partnered with [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/) (an award winning New York City based film company)**\n\n# A Journey Worth Documenting\n---\n\nLast week, we were super excited to [announce Steemit Inc's official support of Steem Park!](https://steemit.com/steempark/@hitheryon/steem-park-is-official-steemit-s-first-crowdsourced-marketing-project) It has been an incredible few months developing this project and the support we received from the community has been overwhelming. So before we start this post, we want to send out another resounding THANK YOU!\n\nWhen we, @voronoi and @hansikhouse, first started collaborating again on a joint Steemit account, we had big dreams of what Steemit could do for the design community from the beginning. Steemit, blockchain, and the development of social-media equity could completely transform how we make things, especially in regards to the public like parks, waterfronts, playgrounds, and so on. STEEM Park will not only be an opportunity to showcase Steemit and build a fun park, *it will be the world's first public-interest project funded by public-interest.*\n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmNS4CgFzB9ZZ9i8Wk14HvLhWD15FfnzoCHySYquzgLqV2/Pop-Up_Garden_Final-Gif.gif\n\nThat's why this project is such an incredible thing for us. It is an opportunity to revolutionize a profession that has historically relied on deep private-interest pockets. STEEM Park is a journey to prove that blockchain technology can be the new economic foundation for how we make this world.\n\nThere was no way that we would limit this ambition to just a month's worth of posts. We wanted to make a stand and show the world that Steemit is a powerful new force to be reckoned with and had the potential to shake up content-production industries around the world. So we came up with an idea...\n\n# A Film Showcasing Steemit's Generative Power\n\n---\n\nA couple weeks ago, we met with the founding directors of [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/), New York City's premiere filmmakers for process-based work and development. After an extensive conversation about Steemit and STEEM Park, we collectively decided that a film would be the best way to showcase this effort.\n\nWe're super pumped about having The Timelapse Group onboard for this. They're an award winning company with a portfolio ranging from several Forbes 500 companies to Vimeo Staff Picks and an array of other accolades. These guys are legit and are already on their way of forwarding that talent into STEEM Park!\n\n<center>*Sneak peak...

The line was drawn by Sir Henry McMahon, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government who was acting as the chief negotiator in the Shimla conference between Britain, China and Tibet. \n\nThe Chinese delegate, Ivan Chen, stated he was not authorised to discuss Tibet's border with India. The McMahon line was negotiated between the British and Tibetans, without Chinese participation and when opposed by the Chinese it was declared as a bilateral accord between India and Tibet. The land south of Tibet was declared as British India. This made the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh a part of India. Historically, this area was known as south Tibet. \n\nIn 1950, Tibet lost its status as an independent territory and India took control of the area. In response to China's claim, India argues that China had no sovereignty over Tibet at the time when the McMahon line was drawn. Also historically it has had no claim to the area that is Arunchal Pradesh. It began to raise the claim after it annexed Tibet. Historically, the Ahom rajas and Debrajas of Tawang have had a tributary system with the tribes of Arunachal. \n\nThe Tawang monastery that has links with Lhasa exercised a spiritual and not a temporal influence. The tribes of Arunachal were integrated more to the south as the high passes of 14,000 and 18,000 feet restricted contact with Tibet. There was just about 60-75 km of \"border\" areas where regular contact was possible. So, though some accounts see Tibet \"ceding\" territories to India at the Shimla conference, even ancient travellers like Hieun Tsang speak of the influence of local kingdoms. Also before China's annexation of Tibet, the latter's relations with India were by and large peaceful.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"china\",\"dispute\",\"knowledge\",\"steemit\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"ab4151a0-1382-5796-b894-7a22d682db8d","title":"Do not use You Broadband in India","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 03, 2017","permlink":"do-not-use-you-broadband-in-india","body":"Do not use You Broadband in India because they have 'access to copy of all packets/data from customer'\nhttps://i.redd.it/5oqpdz9zja7z.png","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"fraud\",\"technology\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/i.redd.it\\/5oqpdz9zja7z.png\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":710,"numPages":75,"currentPage":72}}}
