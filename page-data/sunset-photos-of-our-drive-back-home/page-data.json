We met a lot of friends and people we hadn't seen in a long time and somehow completely forgot to take any photos there. Guess we are still so new to photography that it didn't really cross our mind or we were just too busy enjoying our time there.\n\nOn our way driving back we were amazed by the sunset and we suddenly remembered our cameras on our phone and decided to stop here and there and snap some pics. This is a collaborative post between me and @strawhat and the rewards will be shared among us. \n\nHope you like them!\n\n___\n\n#### @strawhat's pics in order of taking them.\n\n\n![20170707_231940.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmed3toAdgraam5pRgrMVvXXjMeDPEmWWfsn6a8Y5R88R1/20170707_231940.jpg)\n\n\n![20170707_233119.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcmTKrKW41XJtRDAHkNS6KRZ9Phb69csLh9TNFnqQiAya/20170707_233119.jpg)\n\n\n![20170707_233322.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWqX6dcYGvJsk7FYzQVXvw66UwY6KjkRAraN6xWdKDsRK/20170707_233322.jpg)\n\n![20170707_234005.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYZAT2hFBEgmft4w8EFaRSrQrkj5Hi7AiJmyLWtMAb8x3/20170707_234005.jpg)\n\n![20170707_234014.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWuz6qNVJxKEP76SPpxbiwAGMLHrq9XS5tRxrribnSMq2/20170707_234014.jpg)\n\n___\n\n#### My pics in the order of taking them.\n\n![IMG_20170707_231939.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQbNeJ3uzdJMefJiMATrBYenK7EaoXzcQ5gJHoctJJQL3/IMG_20170707_231939.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20170707_234337.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmatX8xpw9J8mEZSbEiHDbrhNwkn1M88BsmC4r1o7G3Fy6/IMG_20170707_234337.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20170707_234940.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcCgdyp8R52E5cmgCxaFGauJoxojQe7hqJvgjSBVmnK2Z/IMG_20170707_234940.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20170708_001240.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbWv4TzzqTywMs4ihAyqxUjbxASySbQivzbAnq35AqGNy/IMG_20170708_001240.jpg)\n\n___\n\nThese photos were taken with a Samsung S7 and a Huawei P10 Camera.
