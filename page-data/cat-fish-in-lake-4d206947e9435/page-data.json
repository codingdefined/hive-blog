But what if there are 100s of fish who wants you to feed them.\n\nThis happens in JP Park Lake in Bangalore where people usually feed some bread or buiscuit to the Cat fish. All the fish wait for their food by just keeping their mouth wide open. They too fight for their food with each other. \n\nIt was a nice scene where not only the people love to feed them but fish love to eat what they have been fed.\n\nSome photos:\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/rli8mixju2.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/hj1avi4u0g.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/xv7yeq53wy.jpg)\n\nCamera : Canon 200D, No Editing","created":"November 24, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Cat Fish in Lake","permlink":"cat-fish-in-lake-4d206947e9435","previous":{"title":"When Steemit made you a Billionaire","permlink":"when-steemit-made-you-a-billionaire"},"next":{"title":"Discussion : Should you Save for your Future","permlink":"discussion-should-you-save-for-your-future-1a07620ca8415"}}}}
