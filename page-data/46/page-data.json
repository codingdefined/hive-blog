I totally agree with it that Flexibility at work is important. It is one of the most important things now-a-days besides salary and benefits when you look out for a job. People tend to hunt those jobs which are more flexible including the salary. I know salary comes first, but flexibility is also what job-seekers want when they try to get a new job.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVgC2jEGAZHL7ziCeZDfCtLmfSP5tXKjj5x5dUhBxtEkz/image.png)\nPC: Pixabay\n\nFlexibility can be anything like flexible working hours, ability to work from home, parental leave (both maternity and paternity leave), casual dress code etc. You will have higher job satisfaction when you have flexibility at work. Then you do not have to sit idle for 8 hours even though you do not have work and also you can finish your work on your terms and not bound to a 9-5 work culture. There are lots of reasons why people love Flexibility at work and they are\n\n1. Expansion of Opportunities - Today's workplace environment if very fluid that means an employee is considered as a valuable asset if he can able to adapt in any situation, thus having flexibility gives you that extra time to explore opportunity which you do not get in normal working hours. Just like I do Steemit, whenever I have time in my workplace.\n\n2. Work-Life Balance - Flexibility at work also means a better work-life balance by offering a chance to balance your time between work and life. One more example of work-life balance would be working from home option, in that way you will find yourself more productive than working from the office. In home, there will be less distraction like you do not have to deal with frequent check-ins or loud noise.\n\n3. Enough Parenting Time - This one is not for everyone, but mainly for the new parents. This will help you to take your time off from work for other more important things in life. Taking parental leave is such that option. The advantage of taking leave or working from home for an extended period will help the bonding between the family.\n\n4. Casual Dress - If a person does not like working in a suit or a tie on your neck you should not force that person. You should allow a person to be comfortable while working.\n\nThese are my thoughts that flexibility at work matters because then the person will be much more active and help the organization grow. Please comments your thoughts as well.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"discussion\",\"work\",\"life\",\"freedom\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmVgC2jEGAZHL7ziCeZDfCtLmfSP5tXKjj5x5dUhBxtEkz\\/image.png\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"836a5951-9a13-5d5b-bf93-8de34af1ac77","title":"Sky, Earth and Water on One Frame","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 01, 2017","permlink":"sky-earth-and-water-on-one-frame","body":"This image was taken on my visit to Kerela, India.

Here I will show you the simplest method where you can be up and running with your Portfolio Page in minutes and even without spending a single penny. That's sound awesome right, let's go through it and create awesome looking Portfolio Page.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXEFtKTdfMHk7D4eSbG1Vyy8b1AN8P5wPQf2spMrnbLWG/image.png)\n\n### What all you need?\n<hr>\n\nYou do not have to have a lot of tools to get started, just a GitHub Account (https://github.com/). You might want to know what exactly is Github. Github is a web-based Git or simply Version Control Repository where you can host your code. The advantage of using GitHub is that it tracks all the changes which you have done on your repository so that you can go back to the code to look what was there in the previous version.\n\nFor creating the portfolio page you do not need a lot of Coding experience just a basic HTML, CSS will do. Anyway, I will be creating a demo Portfolio Page which you can use it and start building your awesome Portfolio. \n\nAt first, create an HTML file and a CSS file. I am not going to paste my code here as it will make my post unnecessary long. If you want I have created a demoPortfolio Repository on Github which you can access from https://github.com/codingdefined/demoPortfolio.\n\nNow once you have the repository, head straight to \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmamqHjZU4Qjta2V8PeFtGfkcUaZv83u1wU2EMFuoYYyCB/image.png)\n\nAnd then to Github Pages section and select the Source as master branch. (Branch is useful for creating different version of the codebase like Master, Dev, Stage, etc.)\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYK11xRAzzc8bo8pDzjusafGs8ZKzWm3RSrVevPCs8XtN/image.png)\n\nWhen you do that and click Save, you will see that Your Site is ready and it is published at some URL. Mine is https://codingdefined.github.io/demoPortfolio/. When I open the URL I can see my Portfolio is Live.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXyEvGMjJRnGRZqDwrHbNeUgWR73NH3VCD81ZLyWVWymn/image.png)\n\nWoohoo!!! Without any server knowledge or much coding I have created my portfolio page. Now lets say you have your domain, you can aslo link your domain to this URL. \n\nGoing Back to the Code, what all you need to change to create your Portfolio. \n\n1 -  Change the Image of the Portfolio at line number 29. Just change the src and you are good.\n\n```\n<img src='https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13746289?v=4&s=460' class='slika'>\n```\n<hr>\n2 -  Now from Line 32, change the text whatever you would like to show as per your portfolio.\n\n```\n<div class='info right'>\n <h1>Welcome To CodingDefined's <br>Portfolio!</h1>\n <br>\n  <p>I am a Proud Indian working as a developer in the tech hub of India (Bangalore). \n         I help people to get up and running with the latest technology. \n         I am also a blogger who loves to write about technology and programming. \n         When I am not programming then you can see me roaming around the streets of \n         Bangalore with my Nokia 6 mobile camera to get a cool snap. \n         I believe in helping people in whatever way I can. </p>\n</div>\n```\n<hr>\n3 - Similar to the Step 2 you need to change the Skills you are familiar with at line 43.\n\n```\n<li class='krug'><p>HTML</p></li>\n<li class='krug'><p>CSS</p></li>\n<li class='krug'><p>Javascript</p></li>\n<li class='krug'><p>ASP.Net</p></li>\n<li class='krug'><p>Node.js</p></li>\n```\n<hr>\n4 - Now at last change the social networks to point at your networks at line 82. Only change the URL from below\n\n```\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/codingdefined\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> |\n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Codingdefined\" target=\"_blank\">Google Plus</a> |\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBxB1eH0IjJa4NiL1H-qApg\" target=\"_blank\"> Youtube</a> |\n<a href=\"https://steemit.com/@codingdefined\" target=\"_blank\">Steemit</a>\n```\n<hr>\n\nPretty Much That's it, you are ready to publish your Portfolio Site.

It was â€‹a reminder for me.\n\nSo I want to give something back with this giveaway.\n\n![The conditions.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPwwzXeXAP89XeTdjsG6WABiK4qjDAGcQmQ7JwjZhUmnL/The%20conditions.png)\n\nWhat can you win?\n\nIn total, 75 SBD is in my Pool.
