Healthy not only means that you should have a physique like a bodybuilder or you should have a six-pack. Healthy means that you are happy both physically and mentally. Mentally happy means that you have a positive attitude on any aspects of your life because that can give you the power to cope up with that situation whereas physical happiness means that you are happy with the way you are and will not think what others think about you but you.\n\nNow coming back to the topic how 5 small changes I try to make in my life to live a better life.\n\n1. Wake up early and have a morning walk - From this month I have started waking up at 6 AM which was previously 8 AM which gives me enough time to have 1 hour of walking. One thing I noticed by going for a morning walk is that your perspective on life changes drastically. You get a positive energy which helps you to overcome the present scenario you are in.\n\n2. Try to eat more Home Cooked Meal - We all love to eat out and try all the new restaurants nearby but that not only helps you to gain weight but also empties your pocket. I am also a foodie but still, I started to have 1 or 2 meal a day at home which is helping me big time.\n \n3. Spend more on healthy food than the expensive clothes - I rarely eat fruits thinking it to be an expensive item in our daily life, but as a famous saying \"An Apple a day keeps the doctor away\" is apt at any given day. You need to have as much fiber or healthy elements in your daily food habits thus started to change my perspective to eat fruits more.\n\n4. Read at least 30 minutes - Read motivational articles or good books every day (not only trending posts in Steemit) for at least 30 minutes which changes your perspective of seeing the world.\n\n5. Have a passion - So recently I have started a passion for clicking photos, a little photographer in me. I can tell you that I love taking photos not only because nature or world is beautiful but that helps me to change my focus to something I like. How much time you dedicate yourself in a day, not even 5 minutes. But keeping a passion gives you a \"me\" time which we all need it.","created":"March 07, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"5 Small changes today can help you to live a better life","permlink":"5-small-changes-today-can-help-you-to-live-a-better-life","previous":{"title":"TrueUSD started trading in Bittrex, is it the end of Tether?","permlink":"trueusd-started-trading-in-bittrex-is-it-the-end-of-tether"},"next":{"title":"Quality Slider Bug in Utopian","permlink":"quality-slider-bug-in-utopian"}}}}
