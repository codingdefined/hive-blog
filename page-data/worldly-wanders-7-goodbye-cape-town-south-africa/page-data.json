It really feels like you're in a different country down here.\n\n![IMG_6334-Edit.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbCqqNKRCuxhfEYHrAWaTT2obRoSQUPBMUN78czJwmwgs/IMG_6334-Edit.jpg)\n\nI usually have mixed feelings when a trip comes to an end - I'm sad that I have to go but then I'm actually quite excited to just get home and sleep in my own bed again...\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\nNonetheless, Cape Town has been great! In fact, it was so great that I have already planned another trip to the Mother City for September - yeah!!\n\nIf you missed any of my previous posts for this trip, please check them out here:\n[Worldly Wanders #6 - Two Oceans Aquarium, Cape Town, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldly-wanders-6-two-oceans-aquarium-cape-town-south-africa)\n[Worldly Wanders #5 - Kiteboarders at Scarborough, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldly-wanders-5-kiteboarders-at-scarborough-south-africa)\n[Worldly Wanders #4 - Chapman's Peak, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldly-wanders-4-chapman-s-peak-south-africa)\n[Worldly Wanders #3 - Warrior Toy Museum, Simon's Town, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldly-wanders-3-warrior-toy-museum-simon-s-town-south-africa)\n[Worldly Wanders #2 - Boulders Beach, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldly-wanders-2-boulders-beach-south-africa)\n[Worldly Wanders #1 - Kalk Bay, South Africa](https://steemit.com/travel/@cheeto.blue/worldy-wanders-1-kalk-bay-south-africa)\n\n![IMG_6346-Pano-Edit.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQS2CZTeqGWZVjY7P7ZDQu6CVAYTmhTavzGtGMmQWiXih/IMG_6346-Pano-Edit.jpg)\n\n---\n\nPlease upvote if you liked this post, follow if you want to see more, and let me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nEquipment used:\n[Canon 6D](http://amzn.to/2sWCH11)\n[Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM ](http://amzn.to/2rUbFHv)","created":"July 06, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Worldly Wanders #7 - Goodbye Cape Town, South Africa","permlink":"worldly-wanders-7-goodbye-cape-town-south-africa","previous":{"title":"Explore Hong Kong with me #3- Yuen Long Park 元朗公園 by  @krischy","permlink":"explore-hong-kong-with-me-3--yuen-long-park-"},"next":{"title":"Beautiful India #7 - Udaipur City Palace, Rajasthan","permlink":"beautiful-india-7-udaipur-city-palace-rajasthan"}}}}
