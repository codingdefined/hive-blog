Unfortunately, Alice trusted a 3rd party app with her Active key in the past, and this app got hacked recently.\nAlice is on her summer vacation, and doesn't monitor her Steemit web wallet on a daily basis. Meanwhile, the hacker triggers a 3 day process of withdrawing the $10,000 SBD from savings, with the intent of stealing it.\n\nFortunately Alice uses *SteemData Notify*, sending her immediate notification, which alerts her to cancel the withdrawal, and change her keys, locking the hacker out.\n\n\n## Dust payment based Authentication\nEvery change of settings on your account in *SteemData Notify* is authenticated by a dust payment to @null, containing an unique hash as a memo.\nThe memo hash is derived from a cryptographic signature of the serialized settings object. This ensures that the account owner has authorized a precise and verifiable change. Furthermore the integrity of settings in the *SteemData Notify* database can be verified at any time. Your private keys are never exposed to any 3rd party in this process.\n\n\n![Screenshot from 2017-07-05 18-36-24.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTN6Fm68tynz7sqHDnjKFxMyTMBsCQSoBxaXWK38enXRY/Screenshot%20from%202017-07-05%2018-36-24.png)\n\n## Try it: [notify.steemdata.com](https://notify.steemdata.com/)\n\n-------\n\n*Please note that SteemData Notify is a free service, provided on an as-is basis, with no guarantees of uptime or correctness.

The goal of this report is to provide you with a clear view on what is happening daily on Steemit.\n\n### 1. New users\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-AccountsNew.png\n\nThis chart shows the number of newly registered users on Steemit and how many of them became active. We see that a lot of accounts are registered, but never used.\n\nWarning: this graphic is kind of dynamic! A user can register one day and become a few days later. Therefore, the number of active users on a specific date may change from day to day.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Accounts.png\n\nIn this graph, the orange line shows the total number of registered accounts.\nThe green line shows how many of them have been active at least once (by active, I mean those who made at least one post, comment or upvote). They are included even if they become inactive later.\n\n### 2. Post and comments\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts30.png\n\nThese graphs show the evolution of posts and comments for the whole blockchain lifetime and for the last 30 days. \n\n### 3. Curation \n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Votes.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Votes30.png\n\nThese graphs show the evolution of curation (upvotes) for the whole blockchain lifetime and for the last 30 days\n\n### 4. Active users\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Actives.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Actives30.png\n\nThese graphs show the activity of users over time and in more details for the last 30 days.\n\n### 5. Daily transactions \n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Transactions.png\n\nThis graph shows the number of daily transactions. This give you an idea of the whole activity on the blockchain.\n\n### 6. Categories\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Categories.png\n\nThis graph shows the tag has been the most used for publishing posts for the whole blockchain lifetime.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-CategoriesDay.png\n\nThis graph shows the tag has been the most used for publishing posts last day.\n\n### 7. Distribution\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Reputation.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the reputation among users. Accounts with a reputation lower than 25 have been removed to keep the graph readable.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Levels.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the voting power (it now includes the new \"Inactive\" and \"Red Fish\" levels - check  @steemitboard blog for more info about this).\n\n### 8. Payout evolution\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutMax.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutMax30.png\n\nThese graphs show the maximum reward paid on a post (or comment) for each day (whole blockchain life and last 30 days). \n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutTotal.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutTotal30.png\n\nThese graphs show the total of the distributed payout (posts and comments) for each day.\n<br>\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutAVG30.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-PayoutMedianPosts30.png\n\nThese graphs show the average and median payout per post for the last 30 days.\nThe last  one indicates that if yesterday you got the latest value shown on this chart for your post, you should be happy because there are as much people that have earned more than you than people that have earned less than you. \n\n---\nI hope you find those stats useful. If you would like to see different stats, feel free to drop me a comment. Your feedback is more than welcome.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n---\n\n#### <center>Happy Birthday, Steemians!

Obviously these are subjective and you may disagree with them.</h3>\n\n<h3>1. Security:</h3> Despite it's problems bitcoin is the most secure blockchain.  That makes it harder to attack and more trustworthy since it is almost impossible (or getting to be) to carry out attacks which falsify transactions, double spending etc.\n\n<h3>2. Real world effort:</h3> A considerable amount of real world money, energy and infrastructure goes into mining it.  In a sense that creates a certain base level of value.\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![ThinkstockPhotos-510795912 (1).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVobwBxChibuC17tbH2azpbLNfr5cH9etP8AY2w9JmcA1/ThinkstockPhotos-510795912%20(1).jpg)\n<center>**Bitcoin is the primary gateway to other cryptocurrencies.**</center>\n</div>    \n\n<h3>3. Branding:</h3> Bitcoin is arguably the only cryptocurrency \"brand\" that has recognition in the real world.  \n\n<h3>4. Community:</h3> Bitcoin probably has the largest community backing - you would be hard pressed to find someone who is into cryptocurrencies who doesn't support it.\n\n<h3>5. Segwit 2X:</h3> It seems likely that Segwit 2X will now pass.  This won't solve the scaling issues forever but will help.\n\n<h3>6. Gateway to the Crypto World:</h3> Bitcoin is the primary gateway to all other cryptocurrency tokens and investments - and it will likely stay that way for some time.  If you have no other cryptocurrency and want to buy \"Token X\" you will in most cases need to buy Bitcoin first.\n\n<h3>7. Scarcity Without Some of the Disadvantages:</h3> Bitcoin is very scarce compared to most other cryptocurrencies and monetary systems.  Yes you can divide it up into tiny units without problems but that does not take account of how people psychologically deal with numbers.  \n\nFurther even at it's slowest, bitcoin is infinitely easier and faster to transport than commodities like gold.  \n\nYou can also secure it and hide it more easily than physical money or gold - reducing (but not eliminating) the risk of being robbed.\n___\n<center><h1>Conclusion</h1></center>\n___\n\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n\n![ThinkstockPhotos-187725838.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZVsDRYEgniykyUr2LUGYTvX45EvgnJQMpCuf3QnXKLKt/ThinkstockPhotos-187725838.jpg)\n<center> **IMO opinion the BTC value car has a long way to go!** </center>\n</div>\n\n<h3>It is very subjective as to whether you believe that the current valuation takes these factors into account or not (even assuming you do agree with them).</h3>\n\nOverall I think Bitcoin will be around for the foreseeable future.\n\n**From that perspective and with the limited total tokens (21m) simple demand will mean that valuations in the millions of dollars per token are feasible eventually.**\n\nThat is pure speculation on my part but I believe that it is within the bounds of possibility and given that it is so, it should have an impact on the current price too.\n\n**Feel free to share your own thoughts below.**\n___\n<center><h1>Thank you for reading</h1></center>\n___\n![ThinkstockPhotos-494400097.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT4XkxrBkc4djV4wK1g3xbneXNyyPkKiRaE3bPQuR6REf/ThinkstockPhotos-494400097.jpg)\n\n___\n___\n___\n<div class=\"pull-right\">\n  \n[![Steemithelp.net](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmeE6JX9ueo5L2FzTXhwDKaVhTjtfEuV7TzTnDZ2S193aF/Screenshot%202017-05-14%2012.25.56.png)](https://www.steemithelp.net/)\n\n</div>  \n\n\n## <center>Are you new to Steemit and Looking for Answers?</center>\n\n#### <center>_Please visit:_</center>\n\n# <center>[Steemithelp.net](https://www.steemithelp.net)</center>\n\n#### <center>A collection of guides and tutorials that cover the basics of Steem and Steemit.</center>\n___\n###### <center> _Follow me [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@thecryptofiend) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Soul_Eater_43)._ </center> \n____\n<h6><center>_All uncredited images are taken from my personal [Thinkstock Photography](http://www.thinkstockphotos.co.uk/) account.

Promises are to keep, but I am breaking them, just to break the silence. </b>\n\n<b>Unfortunately last week one of my best friends mom passed away and a couple of days thereafter also my grandmom. Very unfortunate events, especially my friend's mom (too young) which naturally shifts priorities for the last & coming couple of days.</b>\n\nHowever, my family was actually very kind and considered my already planned trip in regards to planning the cremation ceremony of my grandmom, thus as I am writing this I am sitting in a plane from Amsterdam to Lisbon. The coming days (until friday) I am in the city to meet about 15 (potential) locations and suppliers for the SteemFest² program.\n\nNot long  after I return I will be able to finalise all locations and have a budget overview so I know what the minimum ticketprice will be for the event and can launch the site & ticketsale. In the meantime @cass (yeah!) has already offered to make a new look & feel to align SteemFest² with Lisbon's characteristics.\n\nRest assured that I will do my utmost best to make the event (again) as inclusive as possible, by having a not-for-profit ticketprice. This is mainly possible thanks to sponsorships of (for now) mostly fellow Steemians and Steemit.inc!\n\n<h4>State of the Sponsorships</h4>\nLast year I only started sponsorship requests after most of the program was booked & reserved. This year however I felt with the _\"June Bull Boom of the Cryptos\"_ that it would be smart to reach out for support during that period as it would be easier for people and also relatively 'cheap' to support with some Steem.\n\nSofar, the following people have supported the @SteemFest account and make your ticketprice of SteemFest² (way!) lower than the costprice per person:\n- @abit\n- @arhag\n- @blocktrades\n- @pharesim\n- @riverhead\n- @smooth\n- @wackou\n\n<b>Thank you very much guys!</b>\n\nAny additional sponsorship is very welcome, just donate to @SteemFest account for bigger personal donations and/or you can also support the @t-r-f account which is the Travel Reimbursement Fund, a generic fund which will pay out to SteemFest² attendees who apply (in Lisbon) for a travel support payout.\n\nFYI, Still want to sponsor some, but not in the big league? No problems... Wait for the ticketshop to open! Just like last year the ticket pricing will come in several 'support levels', so if Steem was good for you the past year, you are free to buy a more 'expensive' support ticket (which will still be lower than the costprice) which helps making the event great again!\n\n<h4>Great community initiatives on the way!</h4>\n- @jesta fwd'd comment_rewards from his wonderful @chainbb project to @steemfest\n- @joseph gave away 2 (!) all expenses paid trips to Lisbon!\n- @theprophet0 is gave away an airplane ticket as well!\n- @richardcrill's SteemFest Dreams initiative is going strong with a winner elected\n- Many people supported the @t-r-f Travel Reimbursement Fund so far: @knozaki2015 @ausbitbank @firepower @mariandavp @lichtblick @skapaneas @hitmeasap @kevinwong @ericvancewalton @walterj @edb @blueorgy @benjojo. If you want to know more about how the Travel Reimbursement Fund will work, and how payouts will be calculated, check the blogposts on @t-r-f account. \n@kyriacos is going bezerks with all these fancy designs as well :) \n\nFor now, I'm signing off, and going to the taxi to my first meeting with the bus/coach/shuttle company and then I'm heading to HF Fenix Music as it has the swimmingpool on the roof and continue to meetings throughout the coming days.\n\nBy the way.... did you already book a hotelroom in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemfest/@roelandp/steemfest-updates-hotel-s-booking-site-now-available\" target=\"_blank\">official SteemFest² HF Hotels</a>?

It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty. Construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singh II of the Sisodia Rajput family as he shifted his capital from the erstwhile Chittor to the new found city of Udaipur.The palace is located on the east bank of Lake Pichola and has several palaces built within its complex.\n\nThe City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in the state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles, providing a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake Pichola, several historic monuments like the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the palace complex. Nestled within the Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture with the filming of the 1983 James Bond movie Octopussy.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travel\",\"udaipur\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/upload.wikimedia.org\\/wikipedia\\/commons\\/thumb\\/6\\/69\\/Udaipur_City_Palace.jpg\\/1280px-Udaipur_City_Palace.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"2222f9cb-57f5-5aa5-8f41-7ea9dc06401b","title":"Free BitCoin - Get Free Satoshis Slowly and Steadily","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 05, 2017","permlink":"free-bitcoin-get-free-satoshis-slowly-and-steadily","body":"[FreeBitcoin](https://freebitco.in/?r=4943936) is the best website to get free bitcoin and not only that you will get daily interest on the bitcoins you have in your balance.
