Promises are to keep, but I am breaking them, just to break the silence. </b>\n\n<b>Unfortunately last week one of my best friends mom passed away and a couple of days thereafter also my grandmom. Very unfortunate events, especially my friend's mom (too young) which naturally shifts priorities for the last & coming couple of days.</b>\n\nHowever, my family was actually very kind and considered my already planned trip in regards to planning the cremation ceremony of my grandmom, thus as I am writing this I am sitting in a plane from Amsterdam to Lisbon. The coming days (until friday) I am in the city to meet about 15 (potential) locations and suppliers for the SteemFest² program.\n\nNot long  after I return I will be able to finalise all locations and have a budget overview so I know what the minimum ticketprice will be for the event and can launch the site & ticketsale. In the meantime @cass (yeah!) has already offered to make a new look & feel to align SteemFest² with Lisbon's characteristics.\n\nRest assured that I will do my utmost best to make the event (again) as inclusive as possible, by having a not-for-profit ticketprice. This is mainly possible thanks to sponsorships of (for now) mostly fellow Steemians and Steemit.inc!\n\n<h4>State of the Sponsorships</h4>\nLast year I only started sponsorship requests after most of the program was booked & reserved. This year however I felt with the _\"June Bull Boom of the Cryptos\"_ that it would be smart to reach out for support during that period as it would be easier for people and also relatively 'cheap' to support with some Steem.\n\nSofar, the following people have supported the @SteemFest account and make your ticketprice of SteemFest² (way!) lower than the costprice per person:\n- @abit\n- @arhag\n- @blocktrades\n- @pharesim\n- @riverhead\n- @smooth\n- @wackou\n\n<b>Thank you very much guys!</b>\n\nAny additional sponsorship is very welcome, just donate to @SteemFest account for bigger personal donations and/or you can also support the @t-r-f account which is the Travel Reimbursement Fund, a generic fund which will pay out to SteemFest² attendees who apply (in Lisbon) for a travel support payout.\n\nFYI, Still want to sponsor some, but not in the big league? No problems... Wait for the ticketshop to open! Just like last year the ticket pricing will come in several 'support levels', so if Steem was good for you the past year, you are free to buy a more 'expensive' support ticket (which will still be lower than the costprice) which helps making the event great again!\n\n<h4>Great community initiatives on the way!</h4>\n- @jesta fwd'd comment_rewards from his wonderful @chainbb project to @steemfest\n- @joseph gave away 2 (!) all expenses paid trips to Lisbon!\n- @theprophet0 is gave away an airplane ticket as well!\n- @richardcrill's SteemFest Dreams initiative is going strong with a winner elected\n- Many people supported the @t-r-f Travel Reimbursement Fund so far: @knozaki2015 @ausbitbank @firepower @mariandavp @lichtblick @skapaneas @hitmeasap @kevinwong @ericvancewalton @walterj @edb @blueorgy @benjojo. If you want to know more about how the Travel Reimbursement Fund will work, and how payouts will be calculated, check the blogposts on @t-r-f account. \n@kyriacos is going bezerks with all these fancy designs as well :) \n\nFor now, I'm signing off, and going to the taxi to my first meeting with the bus/coach/shuttle company and then I'm heading to HF Fenix Music as it has the swimmingpool on the roof and continue to meetings throughout the coming days.\n\nBy the way.... did you already book a hotelroom in the <a href=\"https://steemit.com/steemfest/@roelandp/steemfest-updates-hotel-s-booking-site-now-available\" target=\"_blank\">official SteemFest² HF Hotels</a>?

It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty. Construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singh II of the Sisodia Rajput family as he shifted his capital from the erstwhile Chittor to the new found city of Udaipur.The palace is located on the east bank of Lake Pichola and has several palaces built within its complex.\n\nThe City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in the state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles, providing a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake Pichola, several historic monuments like the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the palace complex. Nestled within the Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture with the filming of the 1983 James Bond movie Octopussy.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travel\",\"udaipur\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/upload.wikimedia.org\\/wikipedia\\/commons\\/thumb\\/6\\/69\\/Udaipur_City_Palace.jpg\\/1280px-Udaipur_City_Palace.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3ec044da-238d-5784-963c-3b0838f6a332","title":"Free BitCoin - Get Free Satoshis Slowly and Steadily","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 05, 2017","permlink":"free-bitcoin-get-free-satoshis-slowly-and-steadily","body":"[FreeBitcoin](https://freebitco.in/?r=4943936) is the best website to get free bitcoin and not only that you will get daily interest on the bitcoins you have in your balance.

These words sound so similar, this is where the problem comes in.\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FXHMs7el33Q/VHTS5_wRx7I/AAAAAAAAFts/qvHVhcbtoOc/s1600/How-to-Improve-Your-Writing-Skills.jpeg\n[Image credit](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FXHMs7el33Q/VHTS5_wRx7I/AAAAAAAAFts/qvHVhcbtoOc/s1600/How-to-Improve-Your-Writing-Skills.jpeg)\n\nHomophones\n----------\n\nThis is the biggest cause for all the confusing words one can read in someones writing. Why English decided to do this... well if you ask me they just wanted to be difficult. If the English language just decided to be simple and not so confusing, this would all be gone and we would never have to worry about it. \n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9pXiFG3z5M/hqdefault.jpg\n[Image credit](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9pXiFG3z5M/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nIf you ask me English causes a lot of stress and unnecessary worry. It is making me old and grey with all it's rules and exceptions, and extra exceptions to the exceptions.\n\n**Accept/Except**\nAccept:Is a verb, this means that someone or something is doing the accepting.\n\t\nI accept you for being who you are.\nI do not accept your laziness.\n\nExcept: Is a word that functions like \"excluding\".\n\t\nI love ice-cream, except when it is melted.\nMost days are sunny during winter except when there is a cold front.\n \n**Affect/Effect** \nThis is one I often get wrong. A way that I have learnt how to tell the difference, is the **A**. The **A** represents action.\n\nAffect: Is a verb, where something or someone is affecting something else.\n\tThat story affected me more than the others.\n\nEffect: is usually a noun.\n\tThat story *had* an **effect** on my life.\n\nSee how the *had* is now the verb and **effect** is a noun.\n\n**Its/It’s**\nIts: is possessive.\n\tThe clown lost its red nose.\n\nIt's: is a contraction of \"it is\".\n\tIt's going to be a rainy day today.\n\nWe always think that the apostrophe shows possession \"Tim's car\", but its is similar to the words his and her, therefore its is possession. With \"It's\" just break it up into it is \n\n**Loose/Lose**\nAnother one I struggle with. Whenever you need to use loose/lose in the context of, you lost something, just replace the *t* with an *e* to get the right one.\n\nLoose: is not tight, but loose.\n\tThe door was loose.\n\nLose: in the past tense is *lost*.\n\tYou will lose this game if you keep playing like this.\n\n**To/Too**\nToo: indicates, *excess* or means *also*.\n\tI too want to got to the movie\n\tIt is way too much food for me to eat\n\nTo: must be used in all other circumstances.\n\n**Weather/Whether**\nWhen it comes to this one just think of water, there is no *h* in water, therefore weather relates to the conditions around us.\n\tThe  weather is looking bad today, we will get rain.\n\nWhether: is proceeded by an opinion\n\tWeather or not it rains, I will be happy.\n\nThere are many many more of these words.
