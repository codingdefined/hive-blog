I am also looking into my expenses and trying to cut down on it as much as possible. Since I am at home, I don't need a mobile internet connection since I have Wifi at home. I have one big expense that is Home Loan which I cannot defer, so I am budgeting \n\nMy Savings - Home loan amount = Total Cash in Hand\n\n2 - Look for Alternative Income Source - Since we have Hive and Steem, I will try to be more active on the platform just to get the money flowing as a passive income, using that I can sustain my self for some time. Also, I try to create a portfolio for any part-time work in the future.\n\nWhat you are doing for securing money during Corona Pandemic.","created":"April 21, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"AskHive : Securing Money during Corona Pandemic","permlink":"askhive-securing-money-during-corona-pandemic","previous":{"title":"Food - Trying Something Different","permlink":"food-trying-something-different"},"next":{"title":"Food Photography - Gol Gappe / Puchka","permlink":"food-photography-gol-gappe-puchka"}}}}
