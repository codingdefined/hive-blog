The goal of this report is to provide you with a clear view on what is happening daily on Steemit.\n\n### 1. New users\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-AccountsNew.png\n\nThis chart shows the number of newly registered users on Steemit and how many of them became active. We see that a lot of accounts are registered, but never used.\n\nWarning: this graphic is kind of dynamic! A user can register one day and become a few days later. Therefore, the number of active users on a specific date may change from day to day.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Accounts.png\n\nIn this graph, the orange line shows the total number of registered accounts.\nThe green line shows how many of them have been active at least once (by active, I mean those who made at least one post, comment or upvote). They are included even if they become inactive later.\n\n### 2. Post and comments\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts.png\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Posts30.png\n\nThese graphs show the evolution of posts and comments for the whole blockchain lifetime and for the last 30 days. \n\n### 3.

Distribution\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Reputation.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the reputation among users. Accounts with a reputation lower than 25 have been removed to keep the graph readable.\n\nhttps://arcange.eu/steem-images/2017-07-04-Levels.png\n\nThis graph shows the distribution of the voting power (it now includes the new \"Inactive\" and \"Red Fish\" levels - check  @steemitboard blog for more info about this).\n\n### 8.
