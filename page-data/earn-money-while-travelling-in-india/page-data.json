Let’s start with our approach-\n\nDecide the states you want to cover first, you can’t travel all the places in one go. So we need to have a list of top 4-5 places you want to see in order.\n\nNow when you know what you want to explore first, do a little bit of research over that place(rent books from library or just surf over the internet). Continue this activity for your first place for about a week.\n\nKeep a note that to cover a place completely, You have to stay there for around 3 months to explore it completely. Don’t be a tourist, be a traveler.\n\nNow when you know what to expect from the place you are going to land into, I assume you know the cheapest way to travel & stay. So reach the place & stay in any hostel for the initial few days & start interacting with the localites & travelers. Understand the place first - Every city is more than a place; it's a mood, an aspiration, a tropical state of mind.\n\nComing back to the important question, what to do about the money ? There are several things you can do here - Best option being experiment(I am writing all that’s coming to mind right now).\n\nTry to start a travel blog, upload videos & get in touch with travel operators if they have any sort of job for you.\n\nJoin an NGO or local school, That will give you enough money to continue your life in a decent way.\n\nJoin FB groups & post your contact details so that people coming to that place can get in touch with you directly(You have to be sure about the kind of travelers you can be more friendly with and organize tours only for them)\nIn a short span of time you will realize which one suits you the best.\n\nNow we are done with one place and let’s see what all we learned in these last few months-\n\nYou know what you can do the best to earn your daily bread.\n\nWe are done with our first travel place.\n\nWe made a hell lot of friends & made more stories.(A lot of times it turns out that these friends can give you a job or at least a place to crash in there cities)\n\nYou must be thinking, what about my career ??? So what you learned here is more than a lot of us ever learn in our entire lives. You learnt the art of sales, story-telling & consulting and you learnt the skill of living a life full of adventures.","created":"August 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Earn Money While Travelling In India","permlink":"earn-money-while-travelling-in-india","previous":{"title":"Flower Show at Lalbagh Botanical Garden, Bangalore","permlink":"flower-show-at-lalbagh-botanical-garden-bangalore"},"next":{"title":"Travel to Mawlynnong and Dawki in Shillong, Meghalaya","permlink":"travel-to-mawlynnong-and-dawki-in-shillong-meghalaya"}}}}
