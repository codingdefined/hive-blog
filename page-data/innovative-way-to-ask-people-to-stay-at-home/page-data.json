Red Zone is the district where there was an Active case found in last 7 days, Orange Zone is the one where no new case in last 7 days but the active corona cases where present. Green Zone is the one where no new cases found in last 14 days as well as there is no active cases. \n\nSo from 4th May, Government of India divided whole India in these three zones and thus equivalent restrictions where imposed so that people will stay at Hone. The problem is Bangalore is in Red Zone, but still people are coming out of the home just like previous days. Some where chilling out, some are making weekends plan, so and so. \n\nThe Police Department in Bangalore has put up a banner telling about Weekend Planners to take a quiz before heading out.\n\n![xbtbtj.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/xbtbtj.jpg)\nPC- Google.com\n\nNow whatever number you choose after doing the mathematical calculation, it will always come as 9, that means Stay At Home instead of going out.\n\nThis is innovative way to make people understand to stay at home. But my question remains the same, why people I'm Bangalore are coming out even though it is been marked as Red Zone, what is government doing. I know the small owners are the one who are the suffering the most but the government has to provide them some relief instead of opening up everything.\n\nThough, what I found out is that each one of the people on the road are wearing masks which is a good sign, I.e. a sense of responsibility. Hope this coronavirus pandemic ends soon.\n\nBe healthy, Be safe and Please stay at home and don't go out if there is no necessity.","created":"May 09, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Innovative Way to Ask People to Stay at Home","permlink":"innovative-way-to-ask-people-to-stay-at-home","previous":{"title":"Github lanched Github Codespaces","permlink":"github-lanched-github-codespaces"},"next":{"title":"What is Better, Sunrise or Sunset?","permlink":"what-is-better-sunrise-or-sunset"}}}}
