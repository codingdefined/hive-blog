Thus I thought of using it to show all my Utopian posts as a blog. Gatsby has a list of plugins which includes Wordpress, Firebase etc, thus I created Utopian Plugin so that anyone can create their Static site which will show the list of contribution one has done in a field of Open Source.\n\nThe demo site code can be seen in https://github.com/codingdefined/gatsby-utopian-blog, its part of this Development Contribution. The demo site sits on [codingdefined-utopian.surge.sh](https://codingdefined-utopian.surge.sh).\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1519280537/qwci3sk5caj6ivzocmwn.png)\n\nTo Start with this Plugin you need to install it using `npm install gatsby-source-utopian` and then add it to the gatsby-config.js file\n\nIn the gatsby-config.js file you need to add the gatsbt-source-utopian as shown below, where user is the username for which you would like to get all the posts where user is your username.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    {\n      resolve: 'gatsby-source-utopian',\n      options: {\n        user: 'codingdefined',\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nOnce done you can query the GraphQL using the below query which will give you all the information about the posts.\n\n```\n{\n  allUtopianPost{\n    edges{\n      node{\n        id\n        permlink\n        author\n        category\n        created\n        url\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1519280130/cmuubqjhqrs3wx1iipoj.png)\n\nThen we have changed the index.js to get the information from the GraphQL.\n\n```\n<div>\n    {data.allUtopianPost.edges.map(({ node }) => (\n      <div>\n        <a href={`https://utopian.io${node.url}` }>{node.title}</a> \n                       in {node.json_metadata.type} category \n                      on {new Date(node.created).toLocaleDateString()}\n      </div>\n    ))}\n </div> \n```\n\nIt is very simple site which will give teh Title and which category it was posted and when it was posted. Once you click that it will take you to Utopian posts.\n\n### Technology Stack\n- Node.js\n- Gatsby\n- Utopian NPM Package\n\n### Roadmap\nCreate a full fledged blog with Utopian Contribution\n\n### How to contribute?\nYou can create issues or features in either of the repository\n- https://github.com/codingdefined/gatsby-source-utopian (The Source Plugin)\n- https://github.com/codingdefined/gatsby-utopian-blog (The Blog)\n    \n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/introducing-utopian-s-gatsby-plugin\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"February 22, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Introducing Utopian's Gatsby Plugin","permlink":"introducing-utopian-s-gatsby-plugin","previous":{"title":"GitHub Connection and Linked Pull Request not Updating","permlink":"github-connection-and-linked-pull-request-not-updating"},"next":{"title":"Color Challenge - Thursday Green - Path","permlink":"color-challenge-thursday-green-path-45fcc4a360b2c"}}}}
