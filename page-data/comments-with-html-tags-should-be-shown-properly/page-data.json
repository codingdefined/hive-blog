I like to take photos and sometimes it is just a photo which will tell everything without any word spoken. Steepshot gives you an option for that.\n\nI was looking for some posts and found out that SteepShot is not showing the HTML tags correctly. As shown below.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514894556/fbcko8tnhagantuu6pjp.png)\n\nMy Suggestion is that it should show the HTML tags correctly, like </b/> should bold the text inside it just like below. Its not good to see the HTML tags here and there, and people do not able to understand as well.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514894760/uwzutmpakyidg54zpfzd.png)\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/comments-with-html-tags-should-be-shown-properly\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"January 02, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Comments with HTML Tags should be shown properly","permlink":"comments-with-html-tags-should-be-shown-properly","previous":{"title":"New Year Gift by Steem Rocketing to Over $6","permlink":"new-year-gift-by-steem-rocketing-to-over-usd6"},"next":{"title":"Seven Days of Black and White Challenge - Day 5","permlink":"seven-days-of-black-and-white-challenge-day-5"}}}}
