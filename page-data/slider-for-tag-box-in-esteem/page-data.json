I always have to delete the tags and then start over.\n\n![Screenshot_20171212-144841.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513070651/fz3vfnfmmscmotfbl7qy.png)\n\nMy suggestion would be having a google like slider for tags where you can easily slide from left to right and edit if there is any wrong tag or mistake as shown below. \n\n![ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513078482/csjfgxt5bkdnk5kc7qlh.gif)\n\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/slider-for-tag-box-in-esteem\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"December 12, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Slider for Tag Box in eSteem","permlink":"slider-for-tag-box-in-esteem","previous":{"title":"Crypto Price Checker NPM Module","permlink":"crypto-price-checker-npm-module"},"next":{"title":"B&W Photo Contest Entry 1: Theme Christmas","permlink":"b-and-w-photo-contest-entry-1-theme-christmas"}}}}
