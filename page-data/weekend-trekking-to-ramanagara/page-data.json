It is also famous because the iconic Bollywood movie Sholay was shot here. Thus Ramagiri hill is also known as Sholay Hills. \n\nWe went trekking to Ramadevra Betta mountain which is famous for its rocky mountain. We have started our journey around 7:00 AM from Bangalore since it was around 50 Km we have taken our motorbike instead of taking a cab. We have reached Bidadi at 7:45 AM and had our breakfast and started from there around 8:15 AM. Bidadi which is an industrial suburb of Bangalore is associated with bisi thatte idli. Thatte means plate in Kannada and this idli got its name because of its shape as it resembles plate or disc. We got complimentary Vada with Sambhar and Chutney. The price was Rs 50 / $0.8 per plate and it was worth it.\n\n![IMG-20191202-WA0008.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbEg56LkcKbaMvZ8aG8jWYcQroJq7F7xDdTMcHMD3EzpP)\n\nAt around 8:50 AM we reached Ramanagara, the entrance of the road to Ramadevra Betta is located beside a Huge Hanuman statue. From the statue, it was around 2-3 km ride. The gate opens only at 9:00 AM.  The entry fee is Rs 25 / $0.35 per person and Rs 10/ $0.15 for two-wheeler parking.\n\nIt is also known as Vulture Sanctuary but we could not find any. They have ample parking facilities for both four-wheeler and two-wheeler. You will find an entrance that leads to the Rama temple. The climb to the temple is around 400 steps and the steps are easy to climb. \n\n#### Entrance\n\n![IMG_2017.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSrF7hhyaBLS9zevkDfvVPs9KwGwpNx8GvtGG429irC9a)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Hanuman Idol at the Entrance\n\n![IMG_2019.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbWUHdf6JfpF8iZmXVNtQV3wFKByKYgsCsxeFA27bdx9A)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Corridor\n\n![IMG_2018.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQqeeAHWBCFvciZ5jvbdEfzeXUhfGP3R1xy1iZwSXoxtm)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### More Steps\n\n![IMG_2021.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSq8ckDQgacCEJdzD34yMKFZWnjhzWZP7emt3euAxkZuA)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Rocky Visuals\n\n![IMG_2024.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmavrQNZcrZfS3z6MapEm47J9HdJvS3DvBsnaCJEDa1hY3)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Small Caves Spotted\n\n![IMG_2028.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQox6XFQnvHUmSFXZf3GDZgwsxwMU2HY7uzDCPQSHe49t)\n\n![IMG_2029.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmczKynfuZSsqxD2cZGKNt1pb4J7x3GwEpenQbugWb47Wk)\n\n<hr>\n\nAfter climbing 400 steps you will reach to the foothills of the temple. Actually, there is two temples one of Shiva and the other of Ram & Sita.\n\n#### Siva Temple\n\n![IMG_2041.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSfhRqhXRkPpMhHeRwk25YMxXk9DwNEZ4hMTTjkV7Kxpk)\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Ram & Sita Temple\n\n![IMG_2046.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdgzPzuv7tCsJipUzCdFogv7ydQWA1gvMwUPrdeAnZDm5)\n\n<hr>\n\nFrom the temple you need to climb further which is a pure rocky terrain. The path is extreme left of the temple. Some visuals as you climb :\n\n![IMG_2049.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbKzey6qxHmwJ3BAQo9VyNFAUUWSd1odsJYdSFutBHxnn)\n\n![IMG_2050.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTtFR7ReLAw6pMydfSqbNvSjkRTHJkZEop5TNZRqxf5DB)\n\n![IMG_2056.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRgRJTWyMUSKu39hLBbQ2876guGfvVk1BmFES12GVJ1Vk)\n\n![IMG_2058.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRh2HZg1TZcbVE4wDgmLdUm8XozbdNVwrJWmh2c2CTSQ1)\n\n![IMG_2061.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNdKCaxHVZeBX4mXBBPE2E6ASY6ztBpEH5GjP8xmMV5Ym)\n\n![IMG_2057.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR46b8NirK2H3L3RLcJNYuddpdJ8ZN4UVvQo8F3AyCftc)\n\n<hr>\n\nThe last part of the trek is what the scariest part if you have not climbed the rocky mountain before, though anyone can climb it easily. After you climb it, you will love the stunning view from the top. The view provides a panoramic view of the town, the rocky mountain ranges and the forest at the foothills of the mountain.\n\n#### The actual trekking\n\n![IMG_2078.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWYn9DMqwXevZ3sfcuqADnt8fGndDQh6z9my1WWq5fnwi)\n\n#### Stunning View from the Top\n\n![IMG_2079.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZ5XwDYLfiBCFnnoupT7KPgqJTrJAQK7jafmF3NZ8Zg13)\n\n![IMG_2081.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNbgWEtv1uBrqac9KPaSFKC6NaxzXpSbQ6gQaCTv7Ekuk)\n\n![IMG_2083.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUdVHDk3MsWPvtJWw5Tqaq4JzJHmV3T6xuw7QZtTcfMLV)\n\n![IMG_2089.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVJkEQHRzyyZ1xa1g3kE9DNG9rMwMXifwhu1pNySLN81H)\n\n![IMG_2090.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVBdNStmds8v5xP1kjYYtfp9Mc16TDgnxhiD4YgBsZNTJ)\n\n![IMG_2098.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWQDigVy4KQecNAv3REEsu1VyzrbEtGAypfZpPHD7fGCv)\n\nIt was an overall great trekking experience. Though I would not say that it was real trekking though you will get a feel of it. I would say anyone can do this trekking irrespective of your age, though you might end up taking more time than usual.","created":"December 02, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Weekend Trekking to Ramanagara","permlink":"weekend-trekking-to-ramanagara","previous":{"title":"Buying Stocks Made Easier - Groww","permlink":"buying-stocks-made-easier-groww"},"next":{"title":"A Red Flower Amidst Greenery","permlink":"a-red-flower-amidst-greenery"}}}}
