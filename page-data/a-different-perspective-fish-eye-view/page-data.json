The best part for people with DSLR visiting Mysore Palace is that you can click n number of pictures which is not the case for any other palace I have visited.\n\nI happen to get a fish-eye view of Mysore Palace, and it came out really well, better than I thought. Though I did not have any Wide-Lens or Fish-Eye View Lens, the view is inbuilt in Camera 200D. It was a little cloudy that day, which somehow helped my cause otherwise there would have been overlapping clouds in the blue sky wouldn't have given a great shot I believe.\n\n![IMG_1508.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSeLXvudsVATpvhrDdan9Gfaeaz7NvKzMZZ42ptmhbdaG)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/9.0\nExposure | 1/400\nISO | 100","created":"September 11, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Different Perspective - Fish Eye View","permlink":"a-different-perspective-fish-eye-view","previous":{"title":"A Visit to Mango Festival","permlink":"a-visit-to-mango-festival"},"next":{"title":"Monomad challenge - Rhinoceros","permlink":"monomad-challenge-rhinoceros"}}}}
