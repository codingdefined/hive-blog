So I started from Bangalore to celebrate Diwali with my parents in Kolkata. As the flight ticket prices were skyrocketed in the festive season I have to take train which took around 35 hours. \n\nI started on Wednesday, and then reached Kolkata on Thursday. I celebrated Diwali and Kali Puja in Kolkata, few photos of the celebration\n\n![txddqbd91l.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/txddqbd91l.jpg)\n\n![tjyd27elg7.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/tjyd27elg7.jpg)\n\n![lwa9ksrzrx.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/lwa9ksrzrx.jpg)\n\n![hfnjhehg4f.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/hfnjhehg4f.jpg)\n\nThese photos are of 27th, the Diwali day. Then on 29 evening I started from Kolkata to Rajasthan to spend some time with my cousin's, as there was no direct train to Rajasthan Churu District, so i have to go through New Delhi i.e. Kolkata to New Delhi and then New Delhi to Churu which took around 40 hours as I have to stay 5 hours in New Delhi. On 31st morning I reached Churu and then around 10 AM we have started for visiting a temple which is around 130 Kms.\n\n![7kn70rgqrz.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/7kn70rgqrz.jpg) \n\n![9u4uchk8tv.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/9u4uchk8tv.jpg)\n\nAgain tiring day, we reached home around 7 Pm. The next day i have started again from Churu reached New Delhi and then taken a train from New Delhi to Chennai as i was not getting a direct train to Bangalore. It was around 34 hours journey and then waited 3 hours in the Chennai railway station to catch train to Bangalore. Again i have not got a reservation from Chennai so i have taken a general ticket which was equally crowded thus I have to stand around 6 hours to reach Bangalore. I have reached Bangalore in the Monday morning fully tired.\n\nAnd thus my tiring festive season came to an end.","created":"November 06, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A tiring festive season","permlink":"a-tiring-festive-season","previous":{"title":"Created a Less risky and Moderate Profit Mutual Fund Portfolio","permlink":"created-a-less-risky-and-moderate-profit-mutual-fund-portfolio"},"next":{"title":"Is there a Downvoters Gang or is it a Single Person","permlink":"is-there-a-downvoters-gang-or-is-it-a-single-person"}}}}
