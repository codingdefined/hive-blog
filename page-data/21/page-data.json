The problem now-a-days with lot of programmers including me is that we want to build projects but do not know how to start or go about it, like what technology to use or will it be successful or not.\n\nAlso some of us do want to start projects but are stuck about ideas. But to remind everyone that none of the idea is small or big if it solves someone's problem. For that problem your idea or solution will always be great. \n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXJYUkipNqU8J1vPTcDfj649yHnmfkz6fdDKsdDZQQFSp/image.png)\n[Source](https://pixabay.com/en/board-school-self-confidence-2433978/)</center>\n\nI learned the hard way that we should never think about whether the idea will be successful or not  but keep the confidence in me that hopefully my project will benefit that one guy who will use it. Thus its all about the mindset and confidence which helps you to build something. Confidence means that you are facing your fears or concerns and putting yourself out there and do something for yourself.\n\n\n\nConfidence is something where you have a small idea, you will go for it and work for it and try to make it bigger, I should quote too that \"Rome was not built in a day\". You should never over analyze anything and just go for it and start working on it because there is no way to know the future until and unless you step into the future. \n\nLet's take an example, I always thought of creating a Question/Answer website but thinking about StackOverflow and Quora I always hesitant about going for it. Thinking about who will us my website or how can I be better than those. But now I am motivating myself that whether a large number of people will be using it or not, may be there will be those 100 people who will benefit it from the website. \n\nIt will not be a failure for me because I know that I will be successful if I create a website, I will be successful if I get those 100 users using my website, I will be successful to know my website running.\n\nThus I will only say that Start working on your Project Ideas whether you will be successful or not, because failure is the new success.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"philosophy\",\"motivational\",\"indiaunited\",\"india\",\"writing\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmXJYUkipNqU8J1vPTcDfj649yHnmfkz6fdDKsdDZQQFSp\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/board-school-self-confidence-2433978\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"2ee5317c-a8fb-5d59-920b-fa2e4d95e260","title":"Food Photography - Meal With Live Football Screening","author":"codingdefined","created":"June 26, 2018","permlink":"food-photography-meal-with-live-football-screening","body":"Today went to watch France vs Denmark game in GLocal Junction Restaurant in Bangalore.

Now reviewing that code is one of the challenging jobs, why because when you are going through the code you try to understand the context of the code and why the contributor has written it. \n\nThus one of the reasons we ask the developers to write comments is that to know the context and what is he trying to do with the code. Without the comments the code presented is just piece of code which might be a solution to some problem, but if we do not know the problem we cannot judge efficiently that the code is written is good enough to be a solution to that problem or it can be written in a better way. \n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc1zE1ta9435zYyWc9k69VoiJVxBvtgg4DKnFeKrtvYxN/image.png)</center>\nPC : https://www.flickr.com/photos/cloneofsnake/4291278859\n\nFor example, if I ask someone to solve some problem, I know what is the context we are talking about and most probably I will understand all the code written even if I am not very much familiar of that programming language. \n\nAlong with reviewing we are also learning some of the logic which we might not know in the past. Thus its a win situation for us too.\n\nSince as I already mentioned, the importance of commenting the code is not limiting for the users or moderators who are reviewing your changes. It will also be helpful for you in the future to know why have you chosen that logic (though refactoring will also help us to achieve that). But when you are refactoring please also try to explain what have you achieved after refactoring. \n\nWhen you think that there are better ways to do the logic rather than what you have written do write a question in the comment asking for suggestions or improvements.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"steemdev\",\"programming\",\"indiaunited\",\"india\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmc1zE1ta9435zYyWc9k69VoiJVxBvtgg4DKnFeKrtvYxN\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/cloneofsnake\\/4291278859\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":200,"numPages":75,"currentPage":21}}}
