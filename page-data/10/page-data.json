We do not have a lot of things in our hand which we can do to reduce the pollution.\n\nPublic Transport does not get that much attention than an Electric Vehicle, everyone thinks that having electric vehicle can reduce the pollution but what about traffic. Every cities does not have that big lane in roads which can accommodate a lot of vehicle. This is were public transport can become a lot more important.\n\nIf we just focus on benefits then there are below benefits of using public transport.\n\n1. Saves Money\n2. Reduces Pollution\n3. Reduces Traffic Congestion\n4. Reduces fuel need\n\nNow the problem arises with public transport is when you don't have last mile connectivity that means you don't get public transport to and fro where you live. But then you need to balance out the equation if using your own vehicle as well as the Public Transport.\n\nI normally take my bike to office for only 2 days in a week and other 3 days I tend to use Metro to reach to my office. The best thing about Metro for me is that it takes less time than my bike usually takes.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"pollution\",\"palnet\",\"environment\",\"transport\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"7d3baeb6-59a6-5818-9288-676bcc928367","title":"Cooking After Long Time - Vegan Vermicilli","author":"codingdefined","created":"June 29, 2019","permlink":"cooking-after-long-time-vegan-vermicilli-eea29aa4548a1","body":"Today after a long time I have spent time in the kitchen cook ing Vegan Vermicelli.

We are DO Spaces API, which provides RESTful XML API for programmatically managing the data. The API is inter-operable with Amazon's AWS S3 API that means it allows you to interact with the service while using the tools you already know.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmS5MFrNTZWBG5WHi13mm3UdH6NdizisQNWkk45ppZ6d8t/image.png)\n\nCommits : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/140/commits/1db24aa8f84703adad9518915255bdfec74eeaf5\n\nMore Info About the Digital Ocean Spaces with React.js can be found at : https://www.codingdefined.com/2019/03/upload-images-to-digital-ocean-spaces.html\n\nWe are also checking if the File is only Images so that user will not upload Audio, Video or any other files \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUqWEoPGAayZqZVmYbZKu8tMkW6yDU1VK2koidAHHwsf6/image.png)\n\nCommits : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/140/commits/4652eb6d56c770b837fd5780c5981f0fa86cf3a9\n\n### Bug Fixes - A Lot of bug fixes have been done\n\nOne of the Issues which we were facing is that whenever there was @ we were adding the \"knacksteem.org/\" in front of it, now if there was a Steemit Link then it is just tampering the whole link. To fix this I have changed the Regex to get only @ which has a space in front of it. Though its not a full proof fix but it will not tamper the links as of now.\n\nCommit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/148/commits/305142d25ece329b9b0a596292bbc4df5bb546a9\n\n### GitHub Account\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"development\",\"technology\",\"knacksteem\",\"programming\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmRPexzp1ht41W1x6rLBhTVx4MCPDsJm14rx42TuWsGrxQ\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmS5MFrNTZWBG5WHi13mm3UdH6NdizisQNWkk45ppZ6d8t\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmUqWEoPGAayZqZVmYbZKu8tMkW6yDU1VK2koidAHHwsf6\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/140\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/148\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem-api\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem-api\\/pull\\/30\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/knacksteem\\/@harry-heightz\\/knacksteem-the-new-den-of-talents-on-steem-blockchaingeneral-overview-and-personal-opinions-ideas-id-7dya4bjgagg\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/140\\/commits\\/1db24aa8f84703adad9518915255bdfec74eeaf5\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2019\\/03\\/upload-images-to-digital-ocean-spaces.html\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/140\\/commits\\/4652eb6d56c770b837fd5780c5981f0fa86cf3a9\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/148\\/commits\\/305142d25ece329b9b0a596292bbc4df5bb546a9\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"ab6e5b0d-4fd5-56e1-a913-3e9dc8237f79","title":"Announcement Feature, Post Payout and Bug Fixes in KnackSteem","author":"codingdefined","created":"February 22, 2019","permlink":"announcement-feature-post-payout-and-bug-fixes-in-knacksteem","body":"### Repository & Pull Requests\n\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/111\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/116\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/120\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/124\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/126\nhttps://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/127\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRPexzp1ht41W1x6rLBhTVx4MCPDsJm14rx42TuWsGrxQ/image.png)\n\n### What is KnackSteem?\n\nKnacksteem is an open source platform on the Steem blockchain that seeks to reward talents on a much broader scale, which eradicates partiality, and infuses transparency, on the blockchain.
