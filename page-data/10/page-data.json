But focus for how long they never say it. Our human brain gets distracted very easily and being in focus requires a hell lot of effort if you want to achieve something. \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/aoxzfexqko.jpg)\n\nFor example if you want to understand a math problem you need to keep your focus till the time that problem is solved but what about the next problem. Should you keep the same focus or you need to start all over again.\n\nWhat have I learn is to keep focus until you can. If even being in focus nothing is going in your way then you need to give yourself a break and start all over again when your mind is fully rested. So many times it happens with me that I could not solve a bug in my code but when I start looking it again with the same intensity and focus the next day some or the other solutions start working.\n\nSo what we call a distraction is not actually a distraction is a way of you mind to say you that give the mind some rest to start focusing again. This also should be taught to you in every phase of life just like everyone taught you to keep focusing.\n\nWe all know life is not easy that means being in focus everyday will not get you the desired result then what should you do. This is were the mentor comes in picture who can help you to come out of that situation. That mentor can be your friend, teacher parents or even your colleague whom you never talk with.","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/aoxzfexqko.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"focus\",\"blog\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e288d573-b2bd-50dd-ab19-3f51aaae9fcf","title":"Are you afraid of coming out of Comfort Zone?","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 06, 2019","permlink":"are-you-afraid-of-coming-out-of-comfort-zone-8873ab06f8d2a","body":"We all have been in our comfort zone from time to time and it's not the bad thing. You should be in your comfort zone until you feel the comfort zone is not comfortable anymore.

For ex, you are in your comfortable job but wanted to do something of your own, that is actually meaning you want to take a risk of losing the job as well as might be losing the money of your new venture if that is not successful. \n\nPeople like me are always afraid to take this bold step because we know that we have a family which depends on us. Now this makes us a mediocre in front of people who has taken a risk and became successful. Until and unless you come out of your comfort zone you will not achive a great success in any field you are in.\n\nThus even if you are not able to come out of the comfort zone try to make your comfort zone uncomfortable. What I mean if you want to start a business along with the job you need to spend your extra time on your business and try to be in focus.","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.pexels.com\\/photos\\/1412270\\/pexels-photo-1412270.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=comfort-zone-growth-1412270.jpg&fm=jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"comfort\",\"palnet\",\"life\",\"blog\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"42b83a4d-fcc2-5242-b8f0-b6813c3921c5","title":"Steemleo - A New Scot Tribe","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 04, 2019","permlink":"steemleo-a-new-scot-tribe","body":"Though everyone is getting familiar with Palnet, now we have a new entry into scot tribe space and that is Steemleo. The setting is very similar to Palnet and you also most probably got an airdrop if you have PAL tokens. According to SteemLeo it is a community for investors. Now, what does that mean, if you are investing anything like Money, Time or Knowledge on anything then this community is for you. \n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQCkkaiW4CZQpdcq7rN9VmUNrSL5YTjcQDswRWLTdaMb8/steemleo.com%20is%20live.png\n\nPC: https://steemit.com/steemleo/@steem.leo/a-new-scot-tribe-on-the-block-or-introducing-steemleo-a-community-for-investors\n\n### What content I will post on SteemLeo?\n\nWe are all into Crypto space, so you might be thinking a lot of posts will be made on crypto. But that is not the only investment we have. If you have some money in your bank, and getting interested that is also one form of investment. If you are into Mutual Funds, that is also one type of investment. When I will be writing anything which revolves around money I will most probably add a steemleo tag.\n\n### Is SteemLeo Moderated?\n\nNow the real question is, is the community moderated for spam. When someone creates 100 of posts which does not have anything related to investment, that too gets posted if you have used the tag. I would like it to be moderated so that we will only see genuine investment posts and not any other posts.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"steemleo\",\"new\",\"scottribe\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/640x0\\/https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmQCkkaiW4CZQpdcq7rN9VmUNrSL5YTjcQDswRWLTdaMb8\\/steemleo.com%20is%20live.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/steemleo\\/@steem.leo\\/a-new-scot-tribe-on-the-block-or-introducing-steemleo-a-community-for-investors\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"fa16c5c2-4178-5cb0-b95f-40f0e8e654a7","title":"Why Use Public Transport","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 01, 2019","permlink":"why-use-public-transport-a556bbfba0e4c","body":"Every now and then we hear so much about pollution and there are very few and ineffective ways to reduce the pollution.

Every cities does not have that big lane in roads which can accommodate a lot of vehicle. This is were public transport can become a lot more important.\n\nIf we just focus on benefits then there are below benefits of using public transport.\n\n1. Saves Money\n2. Reduces Pollution\n3. Reduces Traffic Congestion\n4.

We should know that technology is a space that is forever evolving thus the opportunity to do something might be just around the corner.\n\nSo If you’re a code then it is an opportunity for you. And to quote Walt Disney, “It’s fun to do the impossible.” So, let’s join hands with IBM CALL FOR CODE 2019 Global Challenge and change the world with our coding.\n\n### CALL FOR CODE 2019\n\n>The Call for Code 2019 Global Challenge is a developer competition that seeks technology solutions for natural disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. It is supported by the IBM Code and Response™ initiative, a multi-year program dedicated to creating and deploying open source technologies to tackle the world's biggest challenges.\n\n>Started by David Clark Cause and IBM has committed its association for 5 years. David Clark Cause Launched Call for Code in 2018 alongside Founding Partner IBM. This multi-year global initiative is a rallying cry to developers to use their skills and mastery of the latest technologies, and to create new ones, to drive positive and long-lasting change across the world with their code. The second annual Call for Code Challenge theme is natural disaster preparedness and relief in the context of community health and well-being.\n\n###  OBJECTIVE OF CALL FOR CODE\n\nAs more and more people around the world are affected by these calamities, the need for new approaches toward disaster prevention and response is greater than ever. Today, technology can play a major role in reducing the impact of these incidents. Call for Code has brought together software developers from all over the globe to create innovative. To show the world that developers have the power to save lives in times of natural disaster.Reach out to developers across the world and align them to develop solution/application to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.\n\n###  HOW IT WORKS\n\nTeams are created at the discretion of individual participants with a team being no more than five individuals. Options to find other team members are available through the IBM Coder community.\n\nSubmission name- The name for the solution or team in five words or less.\n\n1. Short description- Describe the team’s solution in 10 words or less.\n2. Long description- Describe the solution in more detail. Give a more detailed description of what you’re building, what problem will it solve, and why it matters in less than 500 words.\n3. Solution roadmap- How mature is the submission and where do you intend to take it from here?\n4.
