In that three days I have been doing things like, getting the vegetables in order, buying firewood ready for winter, shopping on a budget and then paying the bills. \nAnd then we came across a little problem, which we thought was little and turns out its much much bigger. \nThis lovely house that I have bought here is wonderful and we had a small leak coming in from the roof when it rains, looking up the the ceiling there is a huge damp patch. \n\nBulgarians in their hey day did not use fiberglass insulation in the loft and instead used earth between the beams of the ceiling, so as you can imagine there is a lot of weight above my head. \nSo we asked a few people how much it would be to repair the roof, and all three roofers who went up said the lats are rotten and all need replacing, but they can save the tiles. \nSo what I thought was going to be a couple of hundred Leva, now turns out to be 1400 leva. (Around Â£640-$700.) This work is urgent because in the winter when its cold I need the house dry or it can create many problems eg damp, mould, a huge hole in the ceiling. \nWhich then means we have even more money to pay out. \n\n# I need your help \nI have seen the steemit community and what the community can do, I am not proud to do this at all, but getting that much money in a month would take away all my monthly income and leave me with nothing to eat and not even able to pay my bills. So I would be working for the roof and August will be a bad month until I get paid in September.  When the winter hits and that water comes into the house it will freeze inside of the roof affected and I have no heating in there, which means the cold will spread through the house and it will be a sorry winter. \n\nI will end up looking like this (you would not want to see me looking like this.)\n\n(https://steemitimages.com/DQmUkaHsVAxFYomrCiFdbfbJ8cZ84XD6oF3j32ZnQUez8pu/image.png)\n\n\n# How can I help?\n\nI need your upvotes and resteems guys to spread the word even if its just a little it will help right now I have taken no money out of my steem account towards anything I see my posts as an investement into the steem platform and help to grow the community. \nBut this time I am out of options and come to you guys cap in hand. \n\nI will update the post later with the picture of the problem in the hope that you can understand and help me out I would really appreciate it. \n\nGuys help me stay warm this winter. \n\nOnce I have hit my target anything remaining if there is enough I will give back to you guys equally with the remaining SPD. I am not doing this for any profit but merely to help me out in this awkward time.","created":"August 03, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Struggling a little and need some help.","permlink":"struggling-a-little-and-need-some-help","previous":{"title":"Minnows Feed part 4!","permlink":"minnows-feed-part-4"},"next":{"title":"Tallest building in Kolkata - Under clouds","permlink":"tallest-building-in-kolkata-under-clouds"}}}}
