The setting is very similar to Palnet and you also most probably got an airdrop if you have PAL tokens. According to SteemLeo it is a community for investors. Now, what does that mean, if you are investing anything like Money, Time or Knowledge on anything then this community is for you. \n\nhttps://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQCkkaiW4CZQpdcq7rN9VmUNrSL5YTjcQDswRWLTdaMb8/steemleo.com%20is%20live.png\n\nPC: https://steemit.com/steemleo/@steem.leo/a-new-scot-tribe-on-the-block-or-introducing-steemleo-a-community-for-investors\n\n### What content I will post on SteemLeo?\n\nWe are all into Crypto space, so you might be thinking a lot of posts will be made on crypto. But that is not the only investment we have. If you have some money in your bank, and getting interested that is also one form of investment. If you are into Mutual Funds, that is also one type of investment. When I will be writing anything which revolves around money I will most probably add a steemleo tag.\n\n### Is SteemLeo Moderated?\n\nNow the real question is, is the community moderated for spam. When someone creates 100 of posts which does not have anything related to investment, that too gets posted if you have used the tag. I would like it to be moderated so that we will only see genuine investment posts and not any other posts.","created":"July 04, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Steemleo - A New Scot Tribe","permlink":"steemleo-a-new-scot-tribe","previous":{"title":"Why Use Public Transport","permlink":"why-use-public-transport-a556bbfba0e4c"},"next":{"title":"Are you afraid of coming out of Comfort Zone?","permlink":"are-you-afraid-of-coming-out-of-comfort-zone-8873ab06f8d2a"}}}}
