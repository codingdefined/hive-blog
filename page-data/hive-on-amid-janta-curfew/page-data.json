This is a baby step effort to combat coronavirus spread. Though the need for the hour is total shutdown which will happen in the coming days, this day is just to show people how it looks to be inside Home and observe curfew.\n\nSo I am here on Hive amid Janta Curfew. Though being not so social person for me it doesn't matter if I go out or not and I can stay home for long if I have an Internet connection (which is a must) or a good book.  But today since everyone at home, the internet speed has literally came down. \n\n#HiveON","created":"March 22, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Hive On Amid Janta Curfew","permlink":"hive-on-amid-janta-curfew","previous":{"title":"Corona Virus Update - India","permlink":"corona-virus-update-india"},"next":{"title":"My chipadvisor results","permlink":"my-chipadvisor-results"}}}}
