So yesterday I tried to learn Long Exposure Photography using Smartphone. \n\nSince I have a Nokia 6, I do not have an option of changing ISO or Shutter Speed. Because of that I have downloaded Open Camera which has lot of option in Manual Settings which can be changed to get the photo in wherever way you want.\n\nSo since I have to do Long Exposure, I only have to change the ISO and Shutter Speed, which can be changed as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/3tcfo2wjsk.jpg)\n\nSince I was novice in Stutter Speed, I have not changed the settings. So I have clicked with ISO 50 and no change in Stutter Speed. There is no difference in image as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/bjmpf8n5xp.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, there is very less light and only tail lights of few cars can be seen and the whole background is black.\n\nThen I tried to change the Stutter Speed and made it as half. Though I got some photos but they were also not that great as shown below. Even though, it was not great I learned that along with ISO you also need to change the Shutter Speed. \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/wcw9iq0925.jpg)\n\nAs I have learned I changed the ISO to 50 and Sutter Speed to 1/12 s, I started getting some of the good photos as shown below.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/s5kdnbnvsb.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/kxua0uepnh.jpg)\n\n   ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/wif02evj4n.jpg)\n\nThen I edited the first best picture using snapseed and got my first learning successful.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/zenhv2nrze.jpg)\n\nThough I have to learn a lot, but it was a successful experiment or learning.\n\nCamera : Nokia 6, Open Camera","created":"September 01, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Learning Long Exposure Photography","permlink":"learning-long-exposure-photography-1a5810460d6bc","previous":{"title":"What photos look like Painting","permlink":"what-photos-look-like-painting"},"next":{"title":"Krishna Janmashtami ","permlink":"krishna-janmashtami"}}}}
