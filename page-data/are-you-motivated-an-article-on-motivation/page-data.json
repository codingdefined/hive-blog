Motivation is what reasons us to behave, whether or not it is getting a glass of water to lessen thirst or reading an e-book to benefit expertise.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZZPusY2BRtL2ZExhpAYs6S9P2umrfjoDjc82cXJK2ama/image.png)\n\nIn regular usage, the time period motivation is regularly used to explain why someone does some thing. For example, you may say that a scholar is so prompted to get into top college or university that he spends every night time studying.\n\n### What are the things that actually motivate us to act? \n###\n\nInstincts (a natural or innate impulse, inclination, or tendency.) & Drives (to send, expel, or otherwise cause to move by force or compulsion) and Needs (necessity) are three main things which actually motivate us to act. \n\n### Different Types of Motivation\n###\n\nThere are mainly two types of motivation Extrinsic Motivations and Intrinsic Motivation.\n\nExtrinsic motivations are those who arise from outside of the person and often involve rewards consisting of trophies, cash, social popularity or praise. Intrinsic motivations are those who stand up from within the individual, consisting of doing a complicated password puzzle merely for the non-public gratification of solving a hassle.\n\n### Small Story on Motivation\n###\n\nNote : \"This beautiful story came to me via whatsapp but I don't know where it originated\"\n\nA man discovered a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for numerous hours because it struggled to squeeze its body through the tiny hole. Then it stopped as though it couldnâ€™t move similarly. So the person determined to assist the butterfly. He took a couple of scissors and snipped off the closing bits of cocoon. The butterfly emerged without problems but it had a swollen frame and reduced in size wings.\n\nThe man continued to watch it, expecting that any minute the wings would enlarge and expand enough to support the body, neither happened! In fact the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around. It was never able to fly.\n\n**What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand:** The restricting cocoon and the struggle required by the butterfly to get through the opening was a way of forcing the fluid from the body into the wings so that it would be ready for flight once that was achieved.\n\n### Motto of the story\n###\n\nSometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. Going through life with no obstacles would cripple us. We will not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.\n\nI will conclude my post by saying a great quote by a great scientist â€œNo matter how good you are at planning, the pressure never goes away. So I don't fight it. I feed off it. I turn pressure into motivation to do my best.\n\nSo again my question remains the same \"Are you motivated?\"","created":"August 31, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Are you motivated ? - An Article on Motivation","permlink":"are-you-motivated-an-article-on-motivation","previous":{"title":"Fancy Grass in Kolkata - A horse made of Grass","permlink":"fancy-grass-in-kolkata-a-horse-made-of-grass"},"next":{"title":"ðŸ“· #ColorChallenge ThursdayGreen \"A White Tiger and A Normal Tiger\"","permlink":"colorchallenge-thursdaygreen-a-white-tiger-and-a-normal-tiger"}}}}
