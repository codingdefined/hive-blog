Delicious #68 : Poseidon's Table - A restaurant worthy of Gods!","body":"## Dear Steemit friends :\n\n![IMG_9772.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWAwH9LhV7ZbpHUqjoi4Ef1PxZefGFpHheWcSaxrpja4x/IMG_9772.jpg)\n\nThe Atlantis resort in Bahamas has surely drawn the attention of many travellers who seek their own answers to the mystery of the ancient lost city. After thousands of years submerged under the sea, curious explorers now have the chance to make their own pilgrimage to this Utopian relic.\n\nOur adventures thus far have taken us to [The Dig](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-70-the-dig-at-the-lost-city-of-atlantis) where partial ruins of the ancient city have now become the permanent home of a thriving marine ecosystem, buzzing with life.  \n\nSince the 19th  century, historians have renewed their interest in origins of Atlantis, looking for clues as to where the advanced kingdom sank in just one day and one night. Whispers of the Greek island, Santorini remain a subtle yet plausible theory.  My own adventures exploring [Santorini and it's magical sea](https://steemit.com/life/@sweetsssj/kissing-santorini-s-magical-blue-sea) served only as a cathartic  temporary release of my curiosity, ultimately leading my travels to Bahamas for further affirmation. \n\nThe [Big Chair](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-73-a-look-at-the-atlantis-casino-from-a-non-gambler) belonging to Poseidon, gave us a glimpse to where the mighty Olympian once sat as he ruled his Kingdom. Though indeed a God, Poseidon and the other Olympians walked among the realm of the mortals, ruling undetected as they presided over their areas of control.\n\n<center>\n![poseidon.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUMHjq7YUNVpEK5g58cHikBcJuZoGBa32xyCe4fw7t5SG/poseidon.png)\n</center>\n\n\n\n<div class=pull-right>\nhttp://www.poseidonspantry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/poseidon-blank-worn1.png\n</div>\n\n### Poseidon \n\n***Poseidon*** was of course, the Greek god of the sea. After defeating the Titans, the world was divided into three. Poseidon drew the Sea straw and hence forth became the protector of all waters as well as all those who depended on them for safe passage.\n\nHe wields a three-pronged spear also called a ***Trident*** allowing him to strike the ground producing an earthquake. For this reason, Poseidon was also known as ***\"The Earth Shaker\"***.  \n\nKnown for being arrogant, moody, and always flaunting his masculinity, Poseidon no doubt commanded a God worthy appetite. \n\nMy expeditions as ***Miss. Delicious*** takes us deep into his place of banquet.  ***Poseidon's Table***, a place that delivers both the quantity and quality of food, only worthy of a powerful deity. Dining here is a privilege, one bestowed upon us by right of abode in the heart of Atlantis. \n\nWhat food, fit for a God and his Godly appetite can we expect? \n\nJoin me in the feast and let's find out!\n\n<hr>\n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/c5mOfF/DSC00219.jpg\n\nJust a minutes walk away from Poseidon's Big Chair. We see the marvellous entrance to ***Poseidon's Table***. His Trident piercing through the name as a reminder of his unwieldy power.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hE2w0F/DSC00822.jpg\n\nEntering the main court, we begin to see a style of decor that mimics the unwavering motions of the sea. A wall with a myriad of bubble like holes echoing Poseidon's position as God of the Sea.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/b60G0F/DSC00880.jpg\n\nEnormous bottles frame the upper portion of the walls. Their size, a reminder of the unearthly size of the Gods. \n\n![DSC00934.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcTSAZET3FF3T864LoByxg8tt3v6p1yyf1WxXxWNvVRWz/DSC00934.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k6MZnv/DSC00932.jpg\n\nBehind the wall, the food awaits. Section by section, row by row, food of all sorts await our picking. Let's go through and have a look.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/d4294a/IMG_7827.jpg\n\n***Roasted Vegetables***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hc1OfF/DSC00882.jpg\n\n***Fruits***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fNFG0F/DSC00883.jpg\n\n***Salads***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eqR0Sv/DSC00884.jpg\n\nLots of different Cheeses and cured ham / meat.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dpUb0F/DSC00887.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/m9grHv/IMG_7837.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gTp0AF/IMG_7836.jpg\n\nEven more pre-prepared salads with Olives, Beans, Beetroot etc.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cgZWZa/DSC00888.jpg\n\nThis is the Teppanyaki stir fry section where you can choose your own ingredients and the chef will stir fry it for you!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jjorZa/DSC00922.jpg\n\n***Seasoned Vegetables and Kimchi***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cPvkcv/IMG_7832.jpg\n\n***Freshly roasted meat!***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hfAkcv/IMG_7835.jpg\n\n***Sushi Bar***. The Sushi bar was surprisingly varied. There was all sorts of sushi rolls, nigiri's and even sashimi's.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gj5JVF/IMG_9775.jpg\n\n![IMG_7833.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUHCokvGroV5vG3Lrb5xNFKCgCgY91J9U9edBE6MnKPYZ/IMG_7833.jpg)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kpSXqF/IMG_9773.jpg\n\n***Pizza and make your own pizza***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mkn77v/DSC00891.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mP8Env/DSC00892.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mY9vcv/IMG_7865.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nf6acv/IMG_7864.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fwTz4a/IMG_7863.jpg\n\n***Hot Food section with various curry's, meat stews, vegetable stews etc.***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/d3RZnv/DSC00893.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iTHJEa/DSC00894.jpg\n\n***Boiled Broccoli, Jamaican Rice, Mediterranean Rice***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iqUn7v/DSC00895.jpg\n\n***Crab Salad, Conch Salad, Shrimps Calamari Vinaigrette, Fish Cerviche***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hM9WZa/DSC00897.jpg\n\nThis looks like some sort of curry and Baked Pastry.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/i0R0Sv/DSC00889.jpg\n\nMeat lovers will love this section with ***Sausages, Grilled Chicken Breast, Grilled Steaks and Grilled Salmon***.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eAZLSv/DSC00903.jpg\n\nThe seafood section is perhaps my favourite, it has ***Pealed Shrimps, Smoked Salmon and Mussels***.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dek5ua/DSC00919.jpg\n\nMediterranean foods have a very  good representation. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dGnJEa/DSC00901.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/i73AAF/IMG_7862.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mbuiVF/IMG_7860.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jNuvcv/IMG_7861.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kPKHqF/IMG_7857.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/frzHqF/IMG_7856.jpg\n\n***Make your own Tortilla!***\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/muCw0F/DSC00921.jpg\n\nBread lovers will have no problem finding one that suits their taste.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gx3Env/DSC00898.jpg\n\n#### Desserts!\n\nPerhaps the most comprehensive section of all, the cakes and desserts!\n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iqYQua/DSC00927.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/c46OfF/DSC00928.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/my3Qua/DSC00929.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bRRfAF/IMG_7854.jpg\n\n![IMG_7847.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYbNyWfdJjCXsEqv4YBaW7yNrZ3gzF6F4MvkbQT6CBZQU/IMG_7847.jpg)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/daQ1Hv/IMG_7869.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iADz4a/IMG_7868.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dNPTxv/IMG_7867.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/knf1Hv/IMG_7866.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hyqwja/IMG_7829.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nqGDVF/IMG_7828.jpg\n\n##\n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cL4iVF/IMG_7875.jpg\n\n\n***Ben & Jerry's*** has their own stand here! I of course obliged.\n\n\n![IMG_9780.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmShmGSGs7YYHMtCqtJbaFBNhY7QZVic1gRdGgB9w1pRGV/IMG_9780.jpg)\n\nTo celebrate a true banquet, a surprise mini ***Junkanoo*** sprung out of no where. All the restaurant staff and waiters started dancing and playing on the drums as they paraded around the eating area. \n\nCheck out the video below and see for yourself!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aHE3dWAx86c\n\n<hr>\n\nPoseidon's table is an eatery of epic proportions. There is very little chance that you will not find something you enjoy eating at this place. More likely, you will find it hard to choose what delights to eat and end up missing out on many delicious foods by the time you are full.\n\nMy visit entitled me to but a taste of the food from Poseidon's very ample table and has left me in awe of the food the Atlantians are able to enjoy.\n\nI would recommend fasting an entire day before attempting to conquer this restaurant. Even then, you will likely be defeated by the onslaught of food. At least you will walk away with a personal victory!
