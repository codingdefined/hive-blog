The successful people can be called as lucky or hard working but do you know the reason behind their success.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYXay1LSgZTRoSg1vUwyPZ6z8Yw4FAAy9rYnV1JcjG2eE/image.png)\nPC: [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/motivational-dreams-life-texture-1177436/)\n\nLets first talk about people who cannot achieve their goals or dreams. When you convince them that if they could have tried little harder they might get succeed, they can give you 2X better reason that they will not succeed. They have convinced themselves that they will not put any more effort to pursue their dreams because they cannot achieve their goals but had they figured out why they cannot achieve the goals. They might give you 100s of excuses by giving the blame to their family or stars or lack or opportunities to remove the blame from themselves. \n\nDo you know what the reason for not achieving the Goals, it is that those people have not defined their goal clearly? What people do is that they will see all those things which can help them achieve the goal but do not focus on anyone and they tend to forget what exactly their goal is. If they do not know what they want, they cannot get it. For example, if you have the ship but you do not know the shore, you cannot reach there. \n\nLet's say I went to buy a bike in a location where 100 bikes have been displayed. I can see all the bikes with different colors and sizes. Now if I would have made up my mind that I will only buy a Black color bike, then I have to look through only black color bikes and ignore the rests. Now since I am looking for black bikes more features of the bike are emerging like different sizes or type. This is happening because now I am focusing only on black bikes, that is part of my goal to get a black color bike. Now I can go one more step closure to get all the details of the bike like which model is it and other details which would not have possible if I would have serached through all the bikes.\n\nSimilar thing is required for achieving your goals in life. If you know what you want in life you will able to see only that thing and you will end up getting that because your focus is on that and you have the clarity what you want in life. You will start seeing opportunities as per your goal which will lead you to achieve what you want in life. Along with that you will be able to see finer details which is equally important for your goal which can only be possible when you have the goal in mind and has the focus to get it.\n\nSo if you want many things in life but not a specific thing that you end up getting nothing so to achieve something in life you have to be specific.","created":"March 27, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How to Achieve your Dreams or Goals","permlink":"how-to-achieve-your-dreams-or-goals","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Thursday Green - Somewhere in the forest","permlink":"colorchallenge-thursday-green-somewhere-in-the-forest"},"next":{"title":"Hyderabad Travel #1 - Charminar","permlink":"hyderabad-travel-1-charminar"}}}}
