I remember going through the channel list in the newspaper to know the timings of my favorite cartoons. I remember we hardly go out to a fancy restaurant if we need something to eat we usually prepare at home. I remember we wait for our turn to read the newspaper being in a big family.\n\nNow with the technology advancement as well as everything online, we hardly do anything outside of it. Just to give you an example, I wanted to read a book called \"**Stay Hungry Stay Foolish**\" written by Rashmi Bansal which is about the stories of 25 marketing graduates who left their job to pursue entrepreneurship. I was actually searching for this book for quite some time (I know, I know, I can get it on Amazon.in but who will pay that much delivery charge for a single book), but could not find it offline. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPT3yU7DQkBiysmGXQN9GUFhwcuudSTgJSY6bPdEyC4Gz)</center>\n<center>PC: https:booksforthewise.com</center>\n\nMy friend suggested to read an Audio version of it or try reading it as an ebook. I tried both but to be honest reading a paper book has its own advantage. I am not a big fan of reading books online or listening to it. I could not get a feel, might be an older version of me has a greater role in it. But whatever it is, I don't think that Audio version of a book or a kindle book can ever replace a paper copy of a book. If I am reading a story, I can still consider Audiobooks as it can prove a good bedtime time pass but reading something to gain the knowledge I cannot imagine listening to Audiobooks.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n","created":"October 16, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Paper Books replacement","permlink":"paper-books-replacement","previous":{"title":"Aren't we too tied with Technology","permlink":"aren-t-we-too-tied-with-technology"},"next":{"title":"In House Photos of Deo Bottle","permlink":"in-house-photos-of-deo-bottle"}}}}
