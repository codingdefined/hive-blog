It takes your step from the Google Fit app, though you don't have to install it for using StepSetGo. Now in the lockdown, your movement is very limited where you will move only inside your home thus you cannot complete your daily limit. Thus StepStepGo have changed how they will reward the users based on the activity in these difficult times.\n\nhttps://images.hive.blog/640x0/https://img.esteem.ws/8ls3s1upjm.png\n\nThey say that we all are fighting a common enemy i.e. this Covid-19 pandemic and for they have worked to support and promote a new working environment. The changes they have done are :\n\n1 ) Step to coin conversion rates: Previously for every 1000 outdoor step they were giving 1.25 coins whereas for 1000 indoor steps they were giving 1 coin. Now as every one of us is required to stay indoors and maintain social distancing, they have interchanged the outdoor and indoor steps.\n\nNow 1000 Indoor steps will give you 1.25 coins whereas 1000 outdoor steps will give you 1 coin.\n\n2 ) They have also introduced turbo times where you can earn 1.5 coins for every 1000 steps. Each day there will be 5 time periods of 15 minutes each where your steps will be rewarded extra. Those times are: 7 am to 7:15 am, 10 am to 10:15 am, 1:30 pm to 1:45 pm,  6 pm to 6:15 pm and 10 pm to 10:15 pm. \n\n3 ) Levels become easier: Previously you need to maintain your level for 3 days otherwise you will be downgraded, if you achieve the highest coins of your level for 3 days you will be upgraded. But they have changed, now you need o to achieve the highest coins for our level for 2 days to leveled up whereas you need to maintain your level for 4 days otherwise you will be leveled down.\n\n![Screenshot_20200425-235711.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmSMKgP6jiLFNfLf8BtvUsiz3J7a61gfjTtAwAbuzyzcv9/Screenshot_20200425-235711.png)\n\nWhy I really like this app is not about the coins mainly but because you can actually compete with your friends to see who can walk more in a week thus a sense of competition also helps the cause of keeping users motivated. Though rewarding exercise is not common nowadays, there are a lot of apps or apps which reward you for your daily activity. Our own Actifit is one such example, the only reason for not using it that I have to write my daily activities which looks repetitive for me.\n\nHave you used StepSetGo, how was your experience?","created":"April 25, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Innovative Idea by StepStepGo in Lockdown","permlink":"innovative-idea-by-stepstepgo-in-lockdown","previous":{"title":"Ways to Save Money","permlink":"ways-to-save-money"},"next":{"title":"Sunday Special - Prepared Momo at Home - Food Phtography","permlink":"sunday-special-prepared-momo-at-home-food-phtography"}}}}
