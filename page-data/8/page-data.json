These meetings re mainly done by non-technical people who simply don't understand the basic requirement.\n\n\n\nThey asks us to write estimate about the feature we will be working on and then end of the task they will match all the estimates with the actual. Now the simple equation of software world is that you cannot estimate it correctly because of any unforeseen reason, but they want it to improve our estimates from the next time onwards.\n\nThis type of agile is simply waste of time where you are not giving any benefit to the people other than wasting their time and pushing them to work on a deadline even when the deadline is not their, thus increasing the stress.\n\nWhat should be done in agile is to have a discussions between the team about how to create better software without spending too much time on non-technical stuff. There should be meeting twice a week to know what going well and what not. If you are stuck, if any one else knows the answer, or how you can try to solve it.\n\nOne simple thing I know is that if the development team is not feeling satisfied with any process than you should throw it away to make them comfortable with any process they like. I agree that some or the other Dev will have a problem with any process but you need to keep them happy too. \n\nIn agile we do retrospective which is great because then you know what went well and what not, but here also it should be only telling that \"this should be done better next time\" which is not a correct retrospective. \n\nThe correct retrospective is where you will discuss the problems you face in the entire software life cycle and how you can rectify it next time. Teams will discuss ideas and will surely try to solve it by themselves.\n\n\n\n","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"technology\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"stem\",\"marlians\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f3353dc3-93dc-5d8d-b54f-f7e6fc68a09c","title":"In One Line","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 06, 2019","permlink":"in-one-line","body":"This image was taken in Lal Bagh, Bangalore.

Being in the industry for quite some time I can say that none of those two are always correct and none of those are always false.\n\n![d80nr8prne.jpg](https://img.esteem.ws/d80nr8prne.jpg)\nPC: Pinterest.io\n\nNow in some organisation as a developer your incentive or your yearly reivew directly proportional on how many bugs has been encountered on your feature. Thus we developers always wants to give as buggy feature as much as possible. But being a developer we always miss some edgy case.\n\nNow this is where the unit test can come into picture. Let's take an example of a React app where almost everything is been written as a component. Inside a component we have a lot of components life cycle as well as some functions. Now whenever I write a function I make sure that function should have been pass through unit tests with multiple inputs. If it passes I can continue writing more functions.\n\nIn that way you are not only following the test driven development but also you know all the possible values your function can get and how to not miss those edgy case. One more thing I tend to follow is that more than 90% of the lines of code which I write should have an equivalent test case written which means that my code coverage should always show percentage more than 90.\n\nThough it's easy to say than done because of the tight deadline or any thing which developer has to consider. But when you follow agile first thing to do it to allocate some time for unit test too along with writing case in that way everyone will know that if you want less buggy software you need to give time to the developer for testing his own feature.","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/d80nr8prne.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"developer\",\"programming\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"20831496-e80c-5be3-849a-65903eccdd62","title":"Under the Tree","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 04, 2019","permlink":"under-the-tree","body":"We all carve for this type of shade whenever we walk/run in sunlight to get some fresh air and protect ourselves from direct sunlight.

And all the sip I have is of equity mutual fund to balance any negative returns. \n\nThus in the current scenario I know even if I will not get more returns my investment will not go in negative and also debt comes with an option of almost nil exit load that means even if I redeem my investment I don't have to pay any tax on it which is not the case in equity where you have to invest more than 3 years normally.\n\nWhat do you think is this the right strategy?","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/3scumuueda.png\"],\"tags\":[\"esteem\",\"steemleo\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.0.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"5d5cce2a-ddaa-5554-8533-e651bfa0f496","title":"Duck Swimming in the Lake","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 29, 2019","permlink":"duck-swimming-in-the-lake","body":"It was such a nice view, where you can calmly watch the duck swimming in the lake.
