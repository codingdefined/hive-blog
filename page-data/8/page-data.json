The best part for people with DSLR visiting Mysore Palace is that you can click n number of pictures which is not the case for any other palace I have visited.\n\nI happen to get a fish-eye view of Mysore Palace, and it came out really well, better than I thought. Though I did not have any Wide-Lens or Fish-Eye View Lens, the view is inbuilt in Camera 200D. It was a little cloudy that day, which somehow helped my cause otherwise there would have been overlapping clouds in the blue sky wouldn't have given a great shot I believe.\n\n![IMG_1508.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSeLXvudsVATpvhrDdan9Gfaeaz7NvKzMZZ42ptmhbdaG)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/9.0\nExposure | 1/400\nISO | 100","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"travelphotography\",\"photography\",\"marlians\",\"busy\",\"neoxian\",\"palnet\",\"zzan\",\"creativecoin\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmSeLXvudsVATpvhrDdan9Gfaeaz7NvKzMZZ42ptmhbdaG\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"0120b35d-d71a-5cc2-9ff1-8007322bbd2e","title":"A Visit to Mango Festival","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 10, 2019","permlink":"a-visit-to-mango-festival","body":"We have gone to celebrate the mango festival in Lalbagh this year. The best part of this festival was that you can buy different varieties of mango in cheap and also without worrying about the quality as the mangoes are organic and grown naturally. \n<hr>\nNote: The festival was from May 2019 to June 2019. \n<hr>\nIt was also a good knowledge session to know these many varieties of mangos because normally we came across 2-3 varieties of mango only. \n\n### Few facts:\n\n>1. Mango, the \"King of Fruits\" is an important fruit crop popular for its taste and nutritional benefits.\n>2. The fruit has its origin in Indo-Burma region.\n>3. In India about 40 varieties are commercially grown across various states in tropical, Sub-tropical and coastal areas.\n>4. Cultivated in an area of 25.16 lak hectares with production of 184.31 lak tonnes in India.\n\n![IMG_1333.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTLsYZyUNP4ZwhAvq3dtJt8T9ynz3S5hKz7UUsLQamEib)\n\nIn the above image, you can see Lal Muni, Nazuk Badam and Ostin. Since we were not allowed to go closer the photos were not that clear. Few more varieties are :\n\n### Ostin\n\n![IMG_1329.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qma5GJY4YzfVnwVdJ3MAxahCu8QYDTAAs21GYRZW1foMrM)\n\n### Amrapali\n\n![IMG_1330.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWvBokEBRdYVYnqJcr4TsRQk4V6ezrcZuaqeXtL3wVvzS)\n\n### And my favorite : Alphanso\n\n![IMG_1332.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmX65hJBdCu8ZXZLJfciM9kpD87ySucsPq7LSSVPY9RsDD)\n\nThere were a lot of people attending the festival as who will not buy the organic mangoes in cheap price.\n\n![IMG_1337.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeKEKgUH5fkMYc7XGs4dCVLGzLuADZcwAuVcBHgw6SRnP)\n\n![IMG_1342.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUv5yy1MY7fDaqBofgy7c92bMieD8FUPZcQtAupKApR6L)\n\n![IMG_1341.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZvjX7HbYH7nF1sQwRLFF4TVrSTF2AS96NLkbtPgFzrrc)\n\nOne thing I liked about this festival is that all the sellers were farmers who have come all the way from their native village which is around 200-250 km to sell these mangoes and earn a livelihood. There was no middleman involved which means all the money goes directly to the farmer and they will live happily for the rest of the year and prepare for the next year. \n\nSo if you happen to be in Bangalore in May or June next year, do plan to visit the Mango Festival and buy some tasty mangoes. \n\nBdw I got the box full of Mango this year :\n\n![IMG_1335.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaopawpW6z4EWXJg6GAJLnfVYLP1VfKqTfTgkxr5UbEue)\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"india\",\"neoxian\",\"marlians\",\"palnet\",\"creativecoin\",\"photo\",\"travelfeed\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmTLsYZyUNP4ZwhAvq3dtJt8T9ynz3S5hKz7UUsLQamEib\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qma5GJY4YzfVnwVdJ3MAxahCu8QYDTAAs21GYRZW1foMrM\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmWvBokEBRdYVYnqJcr4TsRQk4V6ezrcZuaqeXtL3wVvzS\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmX65hJBdCu8ZXZLJfciM9kpD87ySucsPq7LSSVPY9RsDD\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmeKEKgUH5fkMYc7XGs4dCVLGzLuADZcwAuVcBHgw6SRnP\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUv5yy1MY7fDaqBofgy7c92bMieD8FUPZcQtAupKApR6L\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmZvjX7HbYH7nF1sQwRLFF4TVrSTF2AS96NLkbtPgFzrrc\",\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmaopawpW6z4EWXJg6GAJLnfVYLP1VfKqTfTgkxr5UbEue\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"011e3146-92bc-5efa-b2d3-0fb78707f9fa","title":"An Awesome Architecture","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 09, 2019","permlink":"an-awesome-architecture","body":"When we talk about architecture we often see all the new buildings which comes up everyday which makes us go feel wow.

These meetings re mainly done by non-technical people who simply don't understand the basic requirement.\n\n\n\nThey asks us to write estimate about the feature we will be working on and then end of the task they will match all the estimates with the actual. Now the simple equation of software world is that you cannot estimate it correctly because of any unforeseen reason, but they want it to improve our estimates from the next time onwards.\n\nThis type of agile is simply waste of time where you are not giving any benefit to the people other than wasting their time and pushing them to work on a deadline even when the deadline is not their, thus increasing the stress.\n\nWhat should be done in agile is to have a discussions between the team about how to create better software without spending too much time on non-technical stuff. There should be meeting twice a week to know what going well and what not. If you are stuck, if any one else knows the answer, or how you can try to solve it.\n\nOne simple thing I know is that if the development team is not feeling satisfied with any process than you should throw it away to make them comfortable with any process they like. I agree that some or the other Dev will have a problem with any process but you need to keep them happy too. \n\nIn agile we do retrospective which is great because then you know what went well and what not, but here also it should be only telling that \"this should be done better next time\" which is not a correct retrospective. \n\nThe correct retrospective is where you will discuss the problems you face in the entire software life cycle and how you can rectify it next time. Teams will discuss ideas and will surely try to solve it by themselves.\n\n\n\n","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"technology\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"stem\",\"marlians\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f3353dc3-93dc-5d8d-b54f-f7e6fc68a09c","title":"In One Line","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 06, 2019","permlink":"in-one-line","body":"This image was taken in Lal Bagh, Bangalore.

Thus we developers always wants to give as buggy feature as much as possible. But being a developer we always miss some edgy case.\n\nNow this is where the unit test can come into picture. Let's take an example of a React app where almost everything is been written as a component. Inside a component we have a lot of components life cycle as well as some functions. Now whenever I write a function I make sure that function should have been pass through unit tests with multiple inputs. If it passes I can continue writing more functions.\n\nIn that way you are not only following the test driven development but also you know all the possible values your function can get and how to not miss those edgy case. One more thing I tend to follow is that more than 90% of the lines of code which I write should have an equivalent test case written which means that my code coverage should always show percentage more than 90.\n\nThough it's easy to say than done because of the tight deadline or any thing which developer has to consider. But when you follow agile first thing to do it to allocate some time for unit test too along with writing case in that way everyone will know that if you want less buggy software you need to give time to the developer for testing his own feature.","json_metadata":"{\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/d80nr8prne.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"developer\",\"programming\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/2.2.0-mobile\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem.app\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"20831496-e80c-5be3-849a-65903eccdd62","title":"Under the Tree","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 04, 2019","permlink":"under-the-tree","body":"We all carve for this type of shade whenever we walk/run in sunlight to get some fresh air and protect ourselves from direct sunlight.
