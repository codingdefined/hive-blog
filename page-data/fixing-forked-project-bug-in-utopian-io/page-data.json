I thought of working on it.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510289336/ykxnbmdf5ehjuqc5tcqw.png)\n\n### Setting Local Server\n\nThe very first thing I have to do it to fork the original project and run it on my local server. Next, I pulled the master branch from my forked repository using command `git pull repository_name master` where repository_name is my forked repository full path.\n\nAfter pulling, I need to install all the node_modules which are used in the Utopian project for that I have ran `npm install` in the same repository where my code resides.\n\nIt will take some time if you are doing it for the first time. Once done, its time to run the code.  For that you need to run `npm run dev-server`. If it runs successfully you will get a message as shown below.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510289483/qfalethcow7xlwcsxvj0.png)\n\nWhen you navigate to the http://localhost:3000/ you can see the utopian running on your local server.\n\n### Analysing the Bug\n\nAfter searching in the Github search API, I came to know that the search should include +fork:true while calling the GET API of the repository. \n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510289769/udkc0u6gtitdssn16srp.png)\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nIt was a simple fix where while sending the search term we need to append +fork:true as well. One thing to note here is that if we encode + and : it will not work. So first we need to encode the q parameter and then append the +fork:true.\n\nendpoint: `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?${querystring.encode(q)}+fork:true&sort=stars&order=desc`,\n\nCommits : 1 - https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/commit/8c09b26183d4839eb0eb78cfad0840c0e1196766\n2 - https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/70/commits/51517afa86ecd1d0f2cb039b321a421867d8545a\n\n\nPull Request: https://github.com/utopian-io/utopian.io/pull/70\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Open Source Contribution posted via <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/fixing-forked-project-bug-in-utopian-io\">Utopian.io</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 10, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Fixing Forked Project Bug in Utopian-io","permlink":"fixing-forked-project-bug-in-utopian-io","previous":{"title":"Utopian-io : Github Repository going out of area","permlink":"utopian-io-github-repository-going-out-of-area"},"next":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - Swimming Pool","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue-swimming-pool"}}}}
