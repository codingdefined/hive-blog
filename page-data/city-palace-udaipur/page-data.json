It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty.

It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles, providing a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings. Overlooking Lake Pichola, several historic monuments like the Lake Palace, Jag Mandir, Jagdish Temple, Monsoon Palace, and Neemach Mata temple, are all in the vicinity of the palace complex. Nestled within the Aravali mountain range, these landmarks are associated in popular culture with the filming of the 1983 James Bond movie Octopussy.","created":"July 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"City Palace, Udaipur","permlink":"city-palace-udaipur","previous":{"title":"Free BitCoin - Get Free Satoshis Slowly and Steadily","permlink":"free-bitcoin-get-free-satoshis-slowly-and-steadily"},"next":{"title":"Email Marketing VS Social Media Marketing","permlink":"email-marketing-vs-social-media-marketing"}}}}
