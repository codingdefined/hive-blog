Now whom to blame for increasing temperature, it is none other than Humans. Heat Wave is increasing in cities because it traps heat due to lack of tree cover and paved surface.\n\nAs a recent example, I was reading news where it was written \"10 trees were cut to improve the visibility of hoarding\" in Bangalore. Why the hell would you cut trees to improve the hoarding visibility and that too 10 trees, you can change the location of the hoarding and not cut trees. \n\nWe are making progress in terms of having renewable energy, zero-carbon nuclear power, energy efficiency technologies, and electric vehicles but those are not enough. The very existent of human kind is trees and plants, whereas India in have lost close to 10.6 million hectares green cover between 1999 to 2013.\n\nAmidst all this, there are good news too. Recently I came accross an event where they stated that from the last 395+ Sundays they are planting trees and also maintaining it, and their 400th Sunday will be on 1st July.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmamPP4dxRo7PXpUy3DSpGNwiq62KFp7TTC7c2vGq1ZgP3/image.png)\nPC : https://allevents.in/kolkata/400th-consecutive-environmental-sunday-tree-plantation/433975463668640","created":"May 30, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Hot Summer - Are Humans to be Blamed?","permlink":"hot-summer-are-humans-to-be-blamed","previous":{"title":"Trip to Bangalore Aquarium","permlink":"trip-to-bangalore-aquarium"},"next":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Thursday Green - Leaves","permlink":"547pft-colorchallenge-thursday-green-leaves"}}}}
