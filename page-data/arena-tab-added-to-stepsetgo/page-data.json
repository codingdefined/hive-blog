But today there was a feature added to the app which I guess takes the challenge to the next level, it's called Arena.\n\nSo the app give coins based on the steps you walk daily, but people tend to reach their maximum limit and then stop it. This Arena helps them to challenge them more to get extra coins.\n\n![ktlmwiiqcy.png](https://img.esteem.ws/ktlmwiiqcy.png)\n\nThere are three challenges as of now, but only one activated till now.\n\n1. First challenge is about completing 80000 steps in 7 days i.e. approximately 11500 per day.\n\n2. Second one is about completing 10000 steps in one day, that seams to be the easiest one.\n\n3. The third is little bit challenging as it's asking you to get 250000 steps in 30 days. \n\nI have already started the first challenge and got my 11400 steps done for the day. Hopefully I will be able to walk the same amount of steps everyday. The good thing about it is that in 7 days you will get weekends so even if you could not walk more steps on weekdays you can make up on weekends.\n\nHave you started walking and tracking your steps?","created":"January 06, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Arena Tab added to StepSetGo","permlink":"arena-tab-added-to-stepsetgo","previous":{"title":"2019 Year in Review","permlink":"2019-year-in-review"},"next":{"title":"We Won #IndiaWelcomesCrypto","permlink":"we-won-indiawelcomescrypto"}}}}
