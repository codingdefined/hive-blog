That's true when we have to do the same task again and again, it feels boring. But being in a day job you do not have any other option but have to do the task, so how you will overcome that boredom.\n\nThe reason is simple, try different things. I usually work on ASP.NET and I love it but I always have to manage the legacy code and I could not learn any new technologies coming in my way. So what I have done I started my mini project (though not getting enough time now to work on that) which is on the newer technologies which have its own set of issues and excitement. Thus I can somehow reduce the boredom because now I can spend some hours on the exciting things. \n\nSimilarly, you should also start with some hobby along with Software Development, like playing guitar, traveling or even photography. I too whenever possible try to travel as well as clicking pictures which reduces my boredom quite a lot.
