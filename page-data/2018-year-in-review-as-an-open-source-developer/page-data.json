Though looking at the GitHub which gives me the idea about my contributions in 2018 i.e. [199 contributions in 2018](https://github.com/codingdefined?tab=overview&from=2018-12-01&to=2018-12-31). Though it's not bad, but I would like to start spending more time on Open Source Projects from this year. \n\n![2018.PNG](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeVr5ZmYNb68jjbCCbG2xvJzLABcoknBJCq1M9v1VEmAh/2018.PNG)\n\nAnd I must say @utopian-io has the bigger role to play when bringing the masses to work on Open Source Projects. If I go through the 2017 Year where I have just done over 80 open source contributions, 199 looks great. Though it's not great by any means which I would like to change in 2019.\n\nOne more thing I would like to change in 2019 as compared to 2018 is to focus on one thing completely before jumping on any other thing. I also want to take at least 3 courses this year from Udemy and want to become a better developer.\n\nHappy New Year Guys","created":"January 03, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"2018 Year in Review as an Open Source Developer","permlink":"2018-year-in-review-as-an-open-source-developer","previous":{"title":"Dinner at The Irish House","permlink":"dinner-at-the-irish-house-f369139817b3a"},"next":{"title":"A Cheat Day on the day of Republic Day","permlink":"a-cheat-day-on-the-day-of-republic-day-8b245e0217288"}}}}
