In India, the conflict is also referred to as Operation Vijay (Hindi: विजय, lit. \"Victory\") which was the name of the Indian operation to clear the Kargil sector.\n\nThe cause of the war was the infiltration of Pakistani soldiers and Kashmiri militants into positions on the Indian side of the LOC, which serves as the de facto border between the two states. During the initial stages of the war, Pakistan blamed the fighting entirely on independent Kashmiri insurgents, but documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Indian Army, later supported by the Indian Air Force, recaptured a majority of the positions on the Indian side of the LOC infiltrated by the Pakistani troops and militants. Facing international diplomatic opposition, the Pakistani forces withdrew from the remaining Indian positions along the LOC.\n\nThe war is one of the most recent examples of high-altitude warfare in mountainous terrain, which posed significant logistical problems for the combating sides. It is one of the very few instances of direct, conventional warfare between nuclear states (i.e., those possessing nuclear weapons). India had conducted its first successful test in 1974; Pakistan, which had been developing its nuclear capability in secret since around the same time, conducted its first known tests in 1998, just two weeks after a second series of tests by India.\n\nSource [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War)","created":"July 26, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"18 Years Ago India has won the Kargil War","permlink":"18-years-ago-india-has-won-the-kargil-war","previous":{"title":"White Peocock - Bannerghatta National Park, India","permlink":"white-peocock-bannerghatta-national-park-india"},"next":{"title":"Money can actually ‘buy’ you happiness","permlink":"money-can-actually-buy-you-happiness"}}}}
