I'm okay with people holding different opinions as long as they are open to discussing them. So, here are some people I don't always agree with, but I still choose to follow some of them:\n\n* @everittdmickey has strong view on bots and flagging on Steemit. He's very active here.\n* @shayne may be a bit of a Trump fan, but he's not so bad really ;) I don't buy into some of the things he posts about, but we get along.\n* @mindhunter has different opinions to me on various aspects of politics and finance, but he's a smart guy and one of the most active posters on Steemit.\n* I've known @jumowa for a few years. He thinks I'm a little na√Øve when it comes to trusting the news, but I think I'm less so than most people and I am open to different points of view.\n* @dickturpin is the only one of these I've actually met. We differ in our politics, but otherwise I think we have a lot in common.\n\nJust because you disagree with someone about some topics doesn't mean you can't be friends. We should not be afraid to admit we are wrong sometimes.\n\nOther people are using [the Follow Friday tag](https://steemit.com/trending/followfriday). We need ways to discover people to follow. Just following everyone you encounter will lead to a feed you can't keep up with. It pays to be choosy. I did the [first of these posts](https://steemit.com/steemit/@steevc/fridays-are-for-following-on-steemit) about ten months ago and I think I've done just about every week since then. Steemit is not showing all the posts when you click on the tag these days, but you can find a lot of them with the search.\n\nSteem on!\n\n<p><b><div class=\"pull-left\"><img src=\"https://steevc.keybase.pub/steemit/steevc.png\"></div>\nI'm Steve, the geeky guitarist. </b></p><p>I'll buy <a href=\"https://steemit.com/guitar/@steevc/steem-for-picks\">guitar picks for Steem Dollars</a></p>","created":"July 21, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Follow Friday: People I disagree with","permlink":"follow-friday-people-i-disagree-with","previous":{"title":"Creating The World We Long For!","permlink":"creating-the-world-we-long-for"},"next":{"title":"A look back in time to where we are now.","permlink":"a-look-back-in-time-to-where-we-are-now"}}}}
