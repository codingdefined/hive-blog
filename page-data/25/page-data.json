This is because I know that on Indian City Roads (e.g. Bangalore) it is safe to ride below 60 KMPH. When I hit highway my speed goes up to 80 KMPH, because i know the condition of highway roads are much better than the city roads.\n\nThere is no special skill required to ride a motorbike above 100 KMPH, you just have to press the accelerator and the motorbike which is capable of riding at that speed will do its job. But you have to think that it needs practice to handle the motorbike on that speed.\n\nI see so many teenagers riding at a fast speed which gives them Kick, but that also lead to so many accidents.

But how you are gonna move out? Do Motivational Speeches talk about that?\n\nAll the motivational speeches out there revolve about generating inspirations from someone's life and then asked you do the same, does everyone's life the same? Can everyone do the same task to succeed or to move on from his desperation as discussed in the motivational speech?\n\nWhenever you hear any motivational speech the speaker mainly talked about his own experience or similar incident where someone has overcome it very brilliantly or quote some famous quotes on motivation. That can motivate the audience but does it actually encourage the audience to succeed in its path until and unless he works on that.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSxJkZD9iwS7gGbyTAWc7b8w7UjZdRy96HmWhkcvxrKuK/image.png)\nPC : https://www.daniel-one.com/2016/11/06/inspiration-motivational-speeches/\n\nI am not denying the fact that Motivational Speeches are good because it moved so many people around the globe to move on and work through all the difficulties they are facing but does only motivational speeches helped them or do they have to start working on it to make it good.</center>\n\n\n### What are your Thoughts on this?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"motivation\",\"india\",\"indiaunited\",\"life\",\"writing\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQme9kA6zRTVR9GsdsDRo8E24diV8y2AhTpo4FYSRAsucB5\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSxJkZD9iwS7gGbyTAWc7b8w7UjZdRy96HmWhkcvxrKuK\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/gretchenrubin.com\\/2017\\/05\\/motivation\",\"https:\\/\\/www.daniel-one.com\\/2016\\/11\\/06\\/inspiration-motivational-speeches\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":240,"numPages":75,"currentPage":25}}}
