Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash will also be supported.\nThe service will be provided in all 1,800 Austrian locations. \n<br>\n<center>![img](https://news.bitpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BP_ToGo_News_E.jpg)</center>\n\n<br>\n\n## How does it work ?\nThe post office issues the user a **code**, which he then redeems on the BitPanda platform using the \"*Bitpanda To Go*\" feature. \nThen, they get *credited* the cryptocurrencies they bought in their BitPanda online wallet. \nEvery user can choose between a **50‚Ç¨**, **100‚Ç¨** and **500‚Ç¨** voucher for cryptocurrencies. \nAll they need for the purchase is an account and a valid E-Mail address.\n#### And that's it - the process is quick and convenient! \n\n<br>\n\n<center>![img](https://i0.wp.com/criptonoticias.com/extra/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/44_1.jpg)</center>\n\n<br>\n\n\n### The Austrian Post is a huge company which now aims to be one of the largest Bitcoin platforms. \nWith their **300,000 users**, they hope to increase their transaction volume to **200 million Euros** - which might sound a lot, but could actually be doable. \n\n### This new initiative also offers  a great deal for offline purchases: it offers the coins for the same price as online!\nThis is not very common yet - most places where you can buy Bitcoin in Person **charge** up to 10% **fees**. \n<blockquote>\n\"Among other things, the main goal of bitpanda was to offer fair prices for the ‚Äúoffline‚Äù purchase of Bitcoins. With the ‚Äò√ñsterreichische Post AG‚Äô as a partner, it allows them to offer the digital assets at cost. This means, that the fee structure by ‚Äúoffline‚Äù purchases via cash is finally aligned with the inexpensive ‚Äúonline‚Äù conditions. Thus, the currencies manage to step further away from their somewhat dubious image and towards a popular and accepted investment and payment method.\"\n\n-BitPanda\n</blockquote>\n\n<center>![img](https://bitconnect.co//upload/image/bit_coin_new/1499852463_6799018966_5tgwqn6TAM.jpg)</center>\n\n<br>\n\n## Initiatives like these are what helps cryptocurrencies get mass-adapted! \n#### The time we're living in is amazing - we are witnessing a digital revolution right before our eyes. \n### The world is slowly realizing the immense potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and we are part of the change! \n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<center>*Images: [1](http://www.bissresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/18887920396_8d680c8848_b.jpg), [2](https://news.bitpanda.com/2017/bitpanda-to-go-bitcoin-co-in-1800-post-office-branches/), [3](https://news.bitpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/BP_ToGo_News_E.jpg), [4](https://i0.wp.com/criptonoticias.com/extra/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/44_1.jpg?resize=1123%2C640&ssl=1), Sources: [1](http://www.businessinsider.de/die-oesterreichische-post-bietet-jetzt-bitcoins-an-2017-7), [2](https://www.btc-echo.de/bitcoins-ab-sofort-bei-der-oesterreichischen-post-erhaeltlich/), [3](http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/boerse/5250321/Bitcoins-ab-sofort-auch-oesterreichweit-bei-der-Post-erhaeltlich), [4](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Oesterreich-Kryptogeld-Gutscheine-bei-der-Post-kaufen-3769321.html), [5](https://www.futurezone.de/b2b/article211203683/Oesterreichs-Post-verkauft-digitale-Kryptowaehrung-am-Schalter.html)*</center>\n\n<p><hr><br>\n<center><p><a href=\"http://steemit.promo\">Want to get featured on my blog?
