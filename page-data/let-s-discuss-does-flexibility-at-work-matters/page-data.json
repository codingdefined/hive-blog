I totally agree with it that Flexibility at work is important. It is one of the most important things now-a-days besides salary and benefits when you look out for a job. People tend to hunt those jobs which are more flexible including the salary. I know salary comes first, but flexibility is also what job-seekers want when they try to get a new job.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVgC2jEGAZHL7ziCeZDfCtLmfSP5tXKjj5x5dUhBxtEkz/image.png)\nPC: Pixabay\n\nFlexibility can be anything like flexible working hours, ability to work from home, parental leave (both maternity and paternity leave), casual dress code etc. You will have higher job satisfaction when you have flexibility at work. Then you do not have to sit idle for 8 hours even though you do not have work and also you can finish your work on your terms and not bound to a 9-5 work culture. There are lots of reasons why people love Flexibility at work and they are\n\n1. Expansion of Opportunities - Today's workplace environment if very fluid that means an employee is considered as a valuable asset if he can able to adapt in any situation, thus having flexibility gives you that extra time to explore opportunity which you do not get in normal working hours. Just like I do Steemit, whenever I have time in my workplace.\n\n2. Work-Life Balance - Flexibility at work also means a better work-life balance by offering a chance to balance your time between work and life. One more example of work-life balance would be working from home option, in that way you will find yourself more productive than working from the office. In home, there will be less distraction like you do not have to deal with frequent check-ins or loud noise.\n\n3. Enough Parenting Time - This one is not for everyone, but mainly for the new parents. This will help you to take your time off from work for other more important things in life. Taking parental leave is such that option. The advantage of taking leave or working from home for an extended period will help the bonding between the family.\n\n4. Casual Dress - If a person does not like working in a suit or a tie on your neck you should not force that person. You should allow a person to be comfortable while working.\n\nThese are my thoughts that flexibility at work matters because then the person will be much more active and help the organization grow. Please comments your thoughts as well.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","created":"October 01, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Let's Discuss Does Flexibility At Work Matters","permlink":"let-s-discuss-does-flexibility-at-work-matters","previous":{"title":"Sky, Earth and Water on One Frame","permlink":"sky-earth-and-water-on-one-frame"},"next":{"title":"ðŸ“· #ColorChallenge - Monday Red- Red Flower ðŸ“·","permlink":"colorchallenge-monday-red-red-flower"}}}}
