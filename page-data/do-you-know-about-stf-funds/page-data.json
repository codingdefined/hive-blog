According to WazirX :\n\n>Smart Token Fund is a simplified and never-done-before way to help you grow your cryptocurrency portfolio. STF's aim is to democratise cryptocurrency trading expertise for everyone. You can choose the right STF Trader for yourself based on the tokens they trade, their trading history, performance, and more. \n\nThe markets look like below, where there is a description of the coin and the latest price and how the trader is doing.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmekbtt5NAyQ5AVmEnWapAdzB9NEU5uzxgsuP4A3WDfJMm/image.png)\n\nI find it good because then I do not have to trade my crypto, there is someone who is doing it for me just like Mutual Fund Manager. But the same time you never know that you will be at loss or profit. In Mutual Funds there is some kind of stability or isk factor which will ascertain us that it is high risk or low risk. But here everything seems like High Risk itself.\n\nI have invested around 10$ just to see how it works and my portfolio is down a bit because of the recent blood bath in crypto space. You can also try to put some amount to see how it goes,  though it's not financial advice.","created":"September 26, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Do you know about STF Funds?","permlink":"do-you-know-about-stf-funds","previous":{"title":"Mysore Palace - Full View","permlink":"mysore-palace-full-view"},"next":{"title":"Do you abandon your old dog?","permlink":"do-you-abandon-your-old-dog"}}}}
