Now according to local reports, India’s Finance Minister Arun Jaitley held a private inter-ministerial meeting to discuss risks and concerns related to bitcoin regulation.\n\nAlso read: Indian Bitcoin Adoption Responds to Government Signalling for Regulation\n\nAfter Hearing Public Opinion Indian Bureaucrats Meet Privately to Discuss Bitcoin Regulation Risks and Benefits\nMany bitcoin proponents are focused on India as they believe the country will be the next in line to recognize and regulate the decentralized currency much like Japan. There have been several meetings and discussions with lawmakers like Parliament member Kirit Somaiya, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, and many other figureheads. \n\nKirit Somaiya has made some negative comments about bitcoin over Twitter in the past, but has recently listened to citizen feedback about regulating the cryptocurrency. This past March, Indian citizens were recently allowed to comment and send feedback on government bitcoin regulation to various politicians.\n\n“I have taken up the issue of bitcoin at various levels, you may send your suggestions to me please,” explains Parliament member Kirit Somaiya this past spring via Twitter.\nMany Senior Officials Attend Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s Inter-Ministerial Meeting\nNow according to sources familiar with Indian government officials, the Finance Minister Jaitley’s inter-ministerial meeting discussed bitcoin regulation after hearing the public’s opinion. Attendees of the meeting included Economic Affairs Secretary Tapan Ray, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya, Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, Financial Services Secretary Anjuly Chib Duggal, and a variety of other Indian lawmakers.\n\nAlthough Indian bureaucrats like Kirit Somaiya are skeptical of bitcoin, Jaitley has asked fellow lawmakers and citizens in the past to embrace the digital age and prepare for a cashless “mission mode” after last November’s demonetization. “Some of the banks have already had a lot of success, contrary to the argument which is made within the political system that Indians are not well adapted to this mode,” Jaitley said at the time.\n\nIndia’s Media Headlines Say Bitcoin Regulation is Favorable Among Officials\n\nRegulating virtual currencies in India has brought a lot of attention to the country’s official stance on bitcoin. This past April, legislators created a committee dedicated to researching the various risks and benefits in regards to India legally recognizing the cryptocurrency. On June 20 Bitcoin.com reported on a local Indian CNBC broadcast that stated most of the committee members said they were in favor of regulatory guidelines for virtual currencies.\n\nIt seems from Indian news outlets, and regional publication headlines, the Finance Ministry, Jaitley, and the Interdisciplinary Committee will be revealing the outcome of bitcoin regulation soon. Sources say no official decisions were made at Jaitley’s private event but “several issues concerning bitcoin were discussed.”","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/c00wa36iff.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"bitcoin\",\"crypto\",\"blog\",\"life\",\"blockchain\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.4.5\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"671b2a0e-f90e-51d1-85fd-d0d9de9cf66d","title":"This Palace is Called Monsoon Palace, India","author":"codingdefined","created":"June 29, 2017","permlink":"this-palace-is-called-monsoon-palace-india","body":"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2811/33481162672_239f622f43_k.jpg\n\nThis is the View from Monsoon Palace situated in Udaipur, India\n\n![IMG_20170303_163404841_HDR.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZpwNQth7hh5DhqB39PjM6PGuMMR174YkhQiSpncZcbzL/IMG_20170303_163404841_HDR.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"india\",\"image\",\"travel\",\"udaipur\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/c1.staticflickr.com\\/3\\/2811\\/33481162672_239f622f43_k.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZpwNQth7hh5DhqB39PjM6PGuMMR174YkhQiSpncZcbzL\\/IMG_20170303_163404841_HDR.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"9e1fb8dc-df44-526e-9393-f7c5775a9ca7","title":"India's Leading BitCoin Exchange","author":"codingdefined","created":"June 29, 2017","permlink":"india-s-leading-bitcoin-exchange","body":"https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cardschat.com%2Fnews%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FPayPal-adding-Bitcoin-for-online-poker-payments.jpg&f=1\n\nIn India, we have two BitCoin Exchange which works very well.

He worked with my mother's sister. That is how he met my mother. My mom was shy, nervous and quiet. ![P1070220.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZCbJGuZm9QfwT3F5Qysv6CxSp6QTFAeng6uRMNaaFPtP/P1070220.JPG) She was an orphan from Costa Rica, adopted and moved to Lexington, Ma when she was 12, without knowing a single word of english at the time. \n\nMy dad would frequent pool parties put on my mom and her sisters. The famous story is my dad would swim to the side of the pool where my mom was and my mom was so nervous she'd swim to the other side. \n\nThis went on and on ... until eventually, my mom gave in. \n\nThey started talking. \n![P1070203.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZdCy4rxLWsyK8jy32FGjW1zk5Bjfn4184TtTHGqMzqh5/P1070203.JPG)\nThen they dated.\n###  It took my dad four months before my mother would even kiss him.\n![P1070214.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbgEr4U4FwhddUi6CSZcjk9MS1rJZSfkv6aw857y3cwpP/P1070214.JPG)\n\n\n\nTwo years later they were married.\n ![P1070224.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbXCYFBLFkwUm8MHGbyiRTMP7u73EFg8Kb4HB37ujPSE6/P1070224.JPG)\n\n![P1060973.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTqhorrVDfiNUC8FEgQD2JrZTDbX9iSFfeSbWpfbny8uH/P1060973.JPG)\n\n![wedding.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTsH2K53JTdCjLfPgUnAzr7SPAfAggYt6QFmN22VRvhsa/wedding.jpg)\n![weddingcar.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmV7FFiJ5ve1GrN9km3rxvgvjJnu8RkdVE6BHQ8Dz5LbEv/weddingcar.jpg)\n\nOne year later they had me.\n\n![P1060988.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWb4cWknhn3ijiefbP8QEQb8dHPYnWinhyECao2UJfuQk/P1060988.JPG)\n\n\n1 year and 7 months later they gave birth to my brother, Johnathan.</center>\n![P1070005.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaPQPsQXaAuom3Zd5cHGWmS4UJvSVbC76rUVfZGfswm5D/P1070005.JPG)\n---\n<center>I am thankful my parents dealt with me and never turned their back on me. I don't know where my life would be if they did and I don't want to think about it. My dad has a real italian temper - going from 0-100 in an instant so it was tough to know as a child how far I could push until it was too late. I was a tortorous kid... </center>\n![mebaby.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYbPv1SKnsbJ8Ynx5GY3Xbn3xaC51o5m5W44FjR35eRKd/mebaby.jpg)\n\n<center>I remember one vacation...\n![usyoung.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdRe1ytXJaRJC2u6DAzxpWzt4ApzZRspWVrpa3tiSCmjJ/usyoung.jpg)\nIt was just my dad and like 7 of us kids (remember huge family) , we were all ages 6-9 at this point and behaving badly. All of us kids were setting each other off. This escalated into everyone throwing absolutely everything at each other. This happened on the day we were leaving from the trip so instead of cleaning up , we were doing the exact opposite.. There was so much mess everywhere! \n I had one cousin trying to be helpful, he took all of our mess and had no idea what to do with it so he put it into the middle of the room. My dad was screaming the entire time for us to stop. My dad was past the point of return and he had to step outside to cool off. When he left, for some reason we thought this was an OK to keep going at it.\n When he re-entered from trying to cool off, He bolted straight past us to the organized mess on the ground and kicked it with such a force, with such an unbelievable kick - I remember, simultaneously, being instantly bewildered AND impressed at how far everything went in every direction. My entire being was so frightened at this point, I was scared  sh*tless.\n I thought I was going to be the next thing kicked into oblivion but not just me, we ALL KNEW he was going to rip our heads off and it was every child for himself. \nWe all scattered. \nWe were  scared. \nWe were screaming bloody murder.\nWe were crying and pissing ourselves -\nand all of us just hoping we weren't going to be the one he caught. Serves us right for being little sh*ts.\n___\n___\n___\n\nMy family has lived in the same house our entire lives. My dad and his brothers built our house in the 1980s. My parents planned my birth and I am grateful everyday that I was meant to be here. Knowing my parents love me more than anything is the greatest gift I could have ever asked for. I thank god everyday to have the best parents. \n![dadme.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmex4eFmnWdqwcsNWHsMWHoCnt8L1RwAUVStHahzKeVbGd/dadme.jpg)\n\nRecently, about two months ago.. \nDad and I were at Mcdonalds. He got a small soda and something off the dollar menu. (at first he wanted to share a small soda... I said, \"no dad, I'll buy you your own soda, don't be cheap\") When he recieved the soda, he looked me dead in the eye and said, very seriously,\n# \"Davey, guard my soda while I'm at the bathroom.\"  \n I waited till he reached the restroom to crack up laughing.\n Thats my dad for you - stopping soda thieves since '57      \n\nThe only thing my dad hates more than soda theives is hospitals... He hates hospitals more than anything. The hospital was the last place he saw his father, back when he was 12 years old and ever since then, understandably, he hates being there. He has been to a hospital once in the last 2 decades, when my grandmother broke her hip...\n That is until last thursday, the 15th. The worst day of my life. At the time, my dad had been having chest pain for three straight days*. Under the urgency of my mother, my father reluctantly scheduled an appointment with his PCP.  Thankfully, in hindsight, his PCP was able to see him that day. If not, there may have been a different outcome. He drew blood and told my dad to go to the hospital, as soon as possible, due to elevated white blood cell coints.\nOn June 16th, Dad was admitted to the ICU at Leahey Clinic in Burlington, MA.\nX-rays were done\n![x-ray1.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXp8KVHoFLfkefmAQqDPmqSNBA4D59FHuCuwcURAP4aQA/x-ray1.jpg)\n\n![x-ray2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmazKHuM8kYbYEV57uGNunHxRMRXwqhPsMFBsKhpZ1k1zH/x-ray2.jpg)\n\n\nX-rays revealed not just 1 major block preventing the flow of blood but TWO major blood clots/blocks. My dad suffered a heart attack! My old man is indestructable and nothing like this is ever suppose to happen. I was floored when I found out, just surreal and unreal, \n##### I sobbed uncontrollably for the first time in my life.   \nDad needed emergency surgery where a balloon catheter was inserted into his femoral artery and came out of his neck. The long cable went all the way to the blockage and inserted stents to hold up the walls of the artery.  \n![femoral.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeYkZ2R21yDVgKc6g8kpVqh4vy5yakieErBSSZYg4TuvK/femoral.jpg)\n\n\nAfter the procedure, my dad developed pnenomia which labored his breathing heavily to the point where he said he could no longer breath and needed an oxygen supply to help with his breathing. Poor dad! He was weak during this time, he could not eat and dropped down to less than 140 pounds while at the hospital. \n![dadsleepinghospital.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmU9tnMP7X9fZ8fHtc8xWiRYwjNp6pNTE4ixayVZu3PCKA/dadsleepinghospital.jpg)\nMy dad is a trooper. He said the experience was a nightmare. He was awake for the whole procedure. Thankfully the procedure was a success. The thing to know about my dad is he's always smiling. He is the only person that I know who smiles when hes sleeping. Yes, he smiles when he's sleeping, everytime he sleeps. Here he is smiling after almost losing his life and coming out the otherside still on top.\n![dad hospital smiling.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY7ZyfuHTCjKiq9MDWauKDRTkaHEQvDXWK8iEVhFaTtGA/dad%20hospital%20smiling.jpg)\nMy dads twin came and visited him around this time. The nurses thought he was my dad! One of them nearly fainted thinking my dad was up and walking around.\n![daddannyhospital.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVj5xR7a6pe1GmMqAumnFN91vsTL8tD1eTxg2nPxbSzgV/daddannyhospital.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n___\n___\n-------------\n\nMy father was released a few day ago from the hospital. He is currently on 7 different drugs, 3 of which he will need for the rest of his life. He still has stents in his arteries.\nHe will be going back to the hospital next week. I think the doctors are waiting to see if the clot comes back. I dont know. All I know is I have my dad back home with us for the time being. My old man is finally back home. We do not when he can go back to work.\nHis breathing is still labored and he is having some trouble talking. He is not back to full health. His spirits are not at 100% and he is currently bound to his chair with little mobility.

Everyone is borrowing money like it’s free, but nothing is free unless you’re a banker or a government. The entire industrialized world is drowning in debt at all levels private, business and public, almost all these countries are roughly 70% consumption based economies. These same countries have a debt based monetary system, which means for anyone who wants to repay their debt, someone else has to borrow that money into existence. \n\n![sb2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZVhiqU7T9AXJEQvQ9e87DB6wLWgR5DMNBnkQ5sj8Rz43/sb2.jpg)\n\n\nSo where does this leave us, if the entire population is drowning in debt who is going to borrow the money to keep the debt expanding, which it must so the debtors can continue to service their loans? If the lending slows because of market saturation there is less money for people to service their debts, and continue to spend to support a 70% CONSUMER based economy. Once this cycle starts to turn down the pool of available money will shrink, the shrinking pool will go more towards paying down the debt instead of consuming. Less consuming will cause job losses that increases unemployment, which will shrink the pool of new borrowers even further. This is the precise reason that all governments have massively increased their debt loads to step in and fill the void of less people borrowing.\n\n\n![sb.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQTZqANLjPbXVsWkKHJUdWKnbzLPv5jQcoLHpvhdKPCsP/sb.jpg)\n\n I can’t see any way out of this situation and the eventual outcome will be a devastating deflationary spiral that will make the great depression look like a picnic. This problem cannot be fixed; it can only be postponed, which is exactly what central banks are doing. This is why we have had record low interest rates globally for an entire decade, which has never happened in the history of mankind. By lowering the rates globally they are tempting the remaining pool of borrowers to dive in and help postpone the inevitable as well as printing  money like there is no tomorrow, because this is what they fear no tomorrow. But to finish off with a happier story, you don’t have to suffer like the majority. Just get at least some of your money out of this collapsing casino and buy some precious metal life preservers for your family.\n\n![g&sb.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYJrha6TWNTYW4ezM5QA4xG4JvLUaWhDueqff5NoVzEfe/g%26sb.jpg)\n\nThanks for the visit to my post.\n\nBy the @silverbug</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"silver\",\"gold\",\"steemsilvergold\",\"teamaustralia\",\"whalepower\"],\"users\":[\"silverbug\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZVhiqU7T9AXJEQvQ9e87DB6wLWgR5DMNBnkQ5sj8Rz43\\/sb2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQTZqANLjPbXVsWkKHJUdWKnbzLPv5jQcoLHpvhdKPCsP\\/sb.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYJrha6TWNTYW4ezM5QA4xG4JvLUaWhDueqff5NoVzEfe\\/g%26sb.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d749774b-36ca-5a7e-b747-6f96b6fdad5d","title":"Fall in Love with Steemit on the very first day","author":"codingdefined","created":"June 28, 2017","permlink":"fall-in-love-with-steemit-on-the-very-first-day","body":"<html>\n<p>Hello Great People, I am a Proud Indian working as a developer in the tech hub of India (Bangalore).
