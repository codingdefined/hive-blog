It is not because of the educational background or the type of work he do – it is mainly because of his life style. Now I am going to list out some of the outstanding features of a software engineer’s life right from the initial phase to the fully developed product.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdHEetQfnQJtYcPWecmtNogc5XZyMFjehpV3RaXsdq4PX/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/artificial-intelligence-robot-ai-ki-2167835/)\n\nMost of us almost have our tags around our neck or in our belts all the time, even when we are out of work. When we walk, when we eat or when we drink. Only some of us are born with silver spoon and rest of us are born with our tags. Sounds funny, but a real fact.\n\nYou know what’s our favorite web site? its google and other search engines. If one day, these search engines goes down – almost every software company around the world is going to face a heavy productivity loss.\n\nBugs are our dear buddies. They are the byproducts of the software we develop. Those who test our software has the habit of filling bugs and we have the habit of saying it’s a feature or its working as expected. Of course we don’t say it all the time, we say it only when we can’t fix the bug. These are the people who are ours biggest night mare.\n\nWorkaround is one common word you are going to hear from us. In simple terms for an example, if we cannot write a program to sum one and one to get two, we will just write a program that’s sum up five and tem, then subtract thirteen from it. Please don’t ask why we do it, it’s a workaround.\n\nWe provide job opportunities to thousands of people around the world. As we are unable to perform our day to day errands due to our work nature. Hence, eventually, there are a lot of third party companies coming up who help us pay our bills, book our tickets and helps us do our basic works. Aren’t we great??\n\nApart from alcoholics, smokers and other forms of people, we also have special kind of people in our industry who are called workaholics. They are special breed of people whom you can find in office any time of the day including weekends. If we drill down to the cause of this issue, we also get to know this is because of the difference between “hard workers” and “people who hardly work”.\n\nFor us, any word with a “e-” as a suffix is quite interesting. We like emails, we work in e-commerce, we book tickets by e-booking. I honestly guess, there should some “e-food” or “e-family” research going on some part of the globe so one day we have everything in “e-“.\n\nWe won’t die if we don’t have air or food or water or shelter. But, we are sure to die if you don’t let us be connected to the internet.\n\nTo conclude I would only like to say that \n\n>“Life of a software engineer can be summarized in twelve words – in right and left click, they live a life without any life\"\nBy Saravana Kumar Murugan\n\nReference : From the web","created":"October 16, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Life of a Software Engineer","permlink":"life-of-a-software-engineer","previous":{"title":"Spring or Autumn?
