No Indian meal is complete if there is no dessert in it. Ingredients and types of desserts differ from region to region in India. Most of them are made up of milk products and sugar. Let's talk about some of them which are shown in this picture. This image was taken in Asha Sweets in Bangalore which is one of the best shops to have Indian Sweets in Bangalore.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUHpSZasTmKYLRkr7GweqARqrBrr1yZPoUqtFzdtjTiLK)\n\n**Rasmalai -** The name Rasmalai comes from two words in Bengali: Rosh which means \"juice\", and molai which means \"cream\" i.e. a combination of Juice and Malai. It is made up of powdered milk, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and oil.\n\n**Rasgulla -** The name Rasgulla comes from two words ras (\"juice\") and gulla (\"ball\"). It is made up of chhena where chhena mixture is formed into small balls and then these balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup.\n\n**Basundi -** Basundi is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. It is mainly famous in Northern parts of India.\n\n**Raj Bhog -** Again one more chhena sweets which is famous in eastern parts of India. It is just another version of Rasgulla which can also be stuffed with dry fruits or mawa and is bigger in size.\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.4\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"sweets\",\"photography\",\"busy\",\"indiaunited\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmUHpSZasTmKYLRkr7GweqARqrBrr1yZPoUqtFzdtjTiLK\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"72a4a1d6-b546-5aba-a3e4-51a4c762a260","title":"Beautiful Flower with Water Droplets","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 11, 2018","permlink":"beautiful-flower-with-water-droplets-8de5efc45d8b2","body":"Rain drenched flower, where the rain drops still exists.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/8mm1c9hfat.jpg)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/8mm1c9hfat.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"smartphonephotography\",\"india\",\"flowers\",\"photo\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"28ad2b1c-5540-5cd1-9959-ef031fc12e3e","title":"An Evening by Burj Khalifa","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 10, 2018","permlink":"an-evening-by-burj-khalifa","body":"The Burj Khalifa is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the photo taken in the evening when the Fountain was about to start.\n\n![IMG-20160213-WA0014.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcJkUvWF1UsytRrjK7NA4QSsFKmr1bmU19B2XTMMxsLP4/IMG-20160213-WA0014.jpg)\n\n### Camera : Nokia 6","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photofeed\",\"cityscapephotography\",\"goldenhourphotography\",\"photography\",\"india\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmcJkUvWF1UsytRrjK7NA4QSsFKmr1bmU19B2XTMMxsLP4\\/IMG-20160213-WA0014.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"7654bb73-9aa4-5e5e-9059-47261fc4df38","title":"A Beautiful Small Flowers","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 09, 2018","permlink":"a-beautiful-small-flowers","body":"It doesn't matter if you are big or small, even the smallest of flowers are beautiful.
