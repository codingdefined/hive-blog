Now we all want to be productive in these times because this time will never come back. Along with productivity, we should start doing what we have dreamt of doing. This is a perfect time because we have ample time in our hands and many of us are getting bored, so why not utilize this time to become better version of yourself.\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/LWekv0HH-image.png)\nPC : Pexels.com\n\nWe should not waste too much time watching the news or surfing social media. I have downloaded some of the Movies, but I have a strict rule to not watch more than 1 movie in 3 days. I also have to spend a considerable amount of time with my kid as she is small. But along with that, I make sure I read or watch videos 1 hour daily. I know we will not get this much time in the future, then why waste. There are things which you can do in this lockdown period.\n\n1. Explore Yourself - I guess this is the perfect time to introspect about you, your character, your behavior as well as your career. Think about what you like about yourself and what you want to improve, and you should work on that to make a better version of yourself after this lockdown.\n\n 2. Get into a reading habit - You might have some books lying in your bookshelf which you always wanted to read but because of time constraint you cannot read, why not get that book out of the shelf and start reading. If you do not have a physical copy of the book, start reading online as there are tons of books available freely.\n\n3. Build a new physique - Yes I am serious, you do not have to go to the gym for good health or physique, you can start today and you can feel the difference in like 10 days that your body is feeling healthy and energetic.\n\n4. Skill Up - Now this is very important if you are a student, a professional or anyone wanted to learn something. This is the time, which will not back again. \n\nTo Skill Up, Pluralsight is giving one-month free access to their courses which says Stay home and Skill Up.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNZGUGNv8ZEJ6XvDbkLD7dREEwaAeqrV9pJZEddsMKti9/image.png)\nPC : https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month\n\nIf you love photography, then why not start with Nikon online courses, which is offering free photography courses all through the month of April (https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/).","created":"April 17, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Are you Skilling Up in Lockdown","permlink":"are-you-skilling-up-in-lockdown","previous":{"title":"What Color Attracts?","permlink":"what-color-attracts"},"next":{"title":"Food - Trying Something Different","permlink":"food-trying-something-different"}}}}
