In India, the birthday of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan is celebrated as Teacher's Day since 1962. \n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmd1K4Yn77sNtPdDwptWRo6VsJCiMtiSbPGHrV9k7DQQ3t)\nPC : https://www.maxpixel.net/Cupcake-Toy-Bear-Teachers-Day-1636605\n\nSo I am taking this opportunity to thank all my teachers, who have taught me so many things in life. Teachers are not only the teachers of my school or college but all those who have taught me simple things to do better in life. I am thanking all of them to be on my side, being a guide to me, correcting me to make me a better person.\n\nFor all of us, the first teachers are our parents, who have taught the lesson from the very beginning, that to be happy and always smiling. They have also taught us that how to sacrifice to bring happiness to others.  \n\nAlong with others, everyone is a teacher to self. We learn so many things from ourselves, thus helping ourselves to become a better person.","created":"September 05, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Happy Teachers Day from India","permlink":"a-happy-teachers-day-from-india","previous":{"title":"What Have I learned Today - 4th September, 2018","permlink":"what-have-i-learned-today-4th-september-2018"},"next":{"title":"Yellow Flower - Photography","permlink":"yellow-flower-photography-599f74d4eee02"}}}}
