There are lot of users who have found a bug and post that in the Utopian without knowing how the issues are created in the Github, they also does not have account on the Github. Also the Github can revoke your token if it is copied anywhere on the internet. Once the token is revoked you need to sync again with the Github.\n\n#### Proposal\n\nMy proposal is to have a Utopian Github Acoount which does the posting on the User's behalf if the users did not syncd their Utopian account with the Github Account. In that way all the issues will be copied to the github and not only in the Utopian Bug-Hunting Category. Also along with the Issue it can write that Utopian.github created the issue on behalf of @codingdefined.\n\n#### Mockups / Examples\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1517127043/o6tqmrtfasipue0ixrns.png)\n\n#### Benefits\nAs I am a bug moderator I need to check the issue posted before on Utopian as well as on the Github, why because as of now if your Github account is not synced with the Utopian the issue will not be posted on the Github. So the benefit of using it is that it will always post the issue on Github whether you have an account on github or not.\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/utopian-github-account-to-post-issues\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"January 28, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Utopian Github Account to Post Issues","permlink":"utopian-github-account-to-post-issues","previous":{"title":"Getting Started With Gatsby.js - Part 2","permlink":"getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-2"},"next":{"title":"[AnimalPhotography] A Camel","permlink":"animalphotography-a-camel"}}}}
