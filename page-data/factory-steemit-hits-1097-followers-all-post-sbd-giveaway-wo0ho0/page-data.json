ALL POST SBD Giveaway!! wo0ho0!!","body":"https://s6.postimg.org/611ijlr75/followers.jpg\n\nWow! So i logged in this morning and was checking my posts, replying to everyone here and then it hit me!! 1097 Followers!! Holy Moly! \n\nThe support from every single one of you guys has been amazing. When i started this project my main aim was to promote steemit and share my passions with the people here. i have been blown away by the amount of support and also the amount of people telling me that they are now getting into motocross just because of my posts, that's amazing!\n\nSo far in my time here i have sponsored other people, given away shirts i have had designed, sponsored the ENTIRE team of kids and adults at my local motocross club (36 riders and kits!) and also run some competitions where i designed, printed and sent out custom shirts. I did this all because of your support! :)\n\n[Custom #factorysteemit Shirts](https://steemit.com/motocross/@b0y2k/steemit-factory-racing-custom-shirts-have-arrived)\n[Sponsoring team kit for my local club](https://steemit.com/motocross/@b0y2k/factory-steemit-pics-from-the-compass-cup)\n[Sponsoring Team rider Brad Clements](https://steemit.com/supercross/@b0y2k/factory-steemit-round-6-iden-adult-a-mx1-photos)\n[Sponsoring Ssekulji Rally car](https://steemit.com/factorysteemit/@b0y2k/factory-steemit-sponsor-ssekulji-for-his-rally-season)\n\nI cannot thank you all enough for backing me with your votes and confidence, you have all allowed me to follow some of my dreams and i continue to do so everyday.\n\nSo to say a little thank you i wish to run a little fun giveaway which hopefully will make a big impact with some of my followers. What better way than a nice Steem dollar giveaway :)\n\nAll comments on this post by the end of the 7 day posting period  will be entered into the competition and all the SBD will be split amongst the three winning people.\n\n# I will split the coins as follows:\n | Place | Prize |\n | ---- | ---- |\n | 1st | 60% |\n | 2nd | 25% |\n | 3rd | 15% |\n\nI will use randompicker to generate the results and they will be public and 100% fair.\nhttps://www.randompicker.com/\n\nThe winners can power up, buy themselves something nice or just go out and have a good time :)\n\nThank you again #steemit for all your support! Love you all and good luck!\n\n----------------------------------\n# Follow me for #factorysteemit and motocross news!\n![https://steemit.com/@b0y2k](https://s6.postimg.org/ah5zitomp/steemit-sponsor.jpg)","created":"July 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Factory Steemit hits 1097 Followers!!
