No one would have predicted this even the great Warren Buffet because you don't know the future. \n\nLet's go by the Quote of Warren Buffet which says \n\n>\"We have long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune-tellers look good.\" I'm amazed at how many investors take market forecasters seriously, even when they have no credible track records of success.\"\n\nThose who all are saying that they knew it, are just falsely trying to sell their narratives. You might be sitting on negative returns or the loss but right now the main goal is to email calm, buy the dip and hold it till the market goes back again.

We need to be long -term investors who just see through the noise. \n\nInvest today for the long-term and you will be rewarded in the future..","created":"May 06, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Be a long term Investor","permlink":"be-a-long-term-investor","previous":{"title":"What has Lockdown taught You","permlink":"what-has-lockdown-taught-you"},"next":{"title":"How to Stay Fit in Lockdown","permlink":"how-to-stay-fit-in-lockdown"}}}}
