Anyone? Bueller…..Bueller…….\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce.2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmd5FvatjQNdAM2ZjwB76yKWafuCFh2va2ehzSWo1mvteh/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce.2.jpg)</center>\n\nHow about avocados? Well, around here avocados are eaten almost religiously and this avocado ranch is such an awesome way to showcase them. It is so good with these egg rolls.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (6).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeAbUqpRNDUAHNX7GGrjLuyAoYfxSikkWcYojLBsC7tz7/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(6).jpg)</center>\n\nOkay, so I’m not gonna lie, photographing these egg rolls totally kicked my butt. In fact, I may never try taking pictures of egg rolls again. I’ll add it to my new year’s resolutions or something.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (3).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdhMtKWSmLC3kPjDBGe62J2mUQ8LqfNhXu92GAHtUsBHp/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(3).jpg)</center>\n\nDon’t ask me why. I really don’t understand why the most innocent looking food can be so extremely difficult for me sometimes. I just couldn’t capture them the way that I wanted. I won’t even admit how long I spent trying to make them look the way I had planned.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce,.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeB7TxHNC1XCuqFZzDnJ1dzunvrKySy4maGAXvXP17imE/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%2C.jpg)</center>\n\nHonestly, my best photos are the ones that I take when I am relaxed and not trying to be a perfectionist. I think my mood shows through my photography. If I am having a bad day or just not all that excited about a recipe then it’s a sure bet the pictures are going to suck. For example, my camera had been misbehaving this day and the weather was creating the worst possible lighting which had me doing nothing short of dancing around trying to keep up and capture the right moments. The point is that it just wasn’t happening, I was frustrated, and I came very close to scratching the entire thing.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (7).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcPxgY8zobsk25ibYNUHEtoZ8DhRZiQDdfewZ2rzwdx4B/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(7).jpg)</center>\n\nOf course, after I had spent forever on these I would have felt even stupider than I already did about it if I didn’t at least get to share them with you guys. I think I’ve said this before and I know that I have told you not to let my amateur photography skills keep you from trying a recipe. I can at least say that these really are delicious. I made them for our Christmas party one year and called them “Feliz Navidad Rolls” or  “Santa Fe-egg Rolls”.\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (2).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQzuPYwjXzN91CgAYcp6svFrjNCuaKUmnSxas9xkd2Hk7/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(2).jpg)</center>\n\nYeah, I know, I’m much cornier than these rolls are. Oh, and I forgot to mention that I made the wrappers from scratch. I’ve never seen egg roll or wonton wrappers in the stores here so I didn’t have much choice but even if you can buy them I recommend trying them at home at least once. You know, just to say you did. Plus it really impresses people. I hope you try them!\n\n<center>![Southwest Egg Rolls and Avacado Ranch Dipping Sauce (5).jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZt5MHAYaTfcM773dRuangrQGWUuqaHfoity26HnW21CK/Southwest%20Egg%20Rolls%20and%20Avacado%20Ranch%20Dipping%20Sauce%20(5).jpg)</center>\n\n![Gringalicious-border.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeAtgZKAWXwvgLCjVWGHdYkDXRjdGAWR4NXf3zxC5g2Y1/Gringalicious-border.png)\n<h2><center>**As always, the recipe is available upon request.
