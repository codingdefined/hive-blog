It's boring, frustrating, and there is no way out.\n\nOnly 10% work because they want to.\n\nWhat would your life look like if you had enough passive income, to do whatever you wanted to do, without worrying about a job to put food on the table?\n\nWhat if everyone had such a passive income?\n\nWhat would the world look like if everyone did what they loved to do, instead of doing something called \"work\" just to put the food on the table?\n\nThis can be achieved eventually with automation.\n\nOnly with automation.\n\nFood production, construction of houses, manufacturing of clothes, laying of roads, driving people around, managing traffic signals, monitoring health and pretty much every mundane task can be taken care of by the machines.\n\nThe machines can grow enough food to last a generation. The machines can build homes to house all the people in the world.\nIf this happens, everything will become so cheap that we can live without needing to work.\n\nAutomation takes away the jobs, but it also makes things cheaper, in the long run.\n\nThe wealth we have accumulated so far should be enough for us to live forever, without working.\n\nAnd no one would need a job.\n\nIf someone wants to sleep all week, let them.\n\nIf someone wants to read all day, let them.\n\nIf someone wants to paint, sing songs, just run, or just get high all the time, let them.\n\nHow would such a world look like?\n\nDon't we want such a world?\n\nThen we need to build it.\n\nEverything that we do today should be to get to that state of the world, where we are taken care of by the machines, and we can do 24/7 what we love to do. Else there is no point in living.\n\nWe may not achieve it in this generation, but eventually we will.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemit\",\"life\",\"philosophy\",\"writing\",\"money\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d752f47e-b1f5-53b0-b447-988ffb80000a","title":"Life too short for a 9 to 5 job","author":"codingdefined","created":"July 31, 2017","permlink":"life-too-short-for-a-9-to-5-job","body":"**Life too short for a 9 to 5 job**\n\n6 AM to 8 AM: Wake up.
