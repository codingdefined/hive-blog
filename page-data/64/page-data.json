For example, my camera had been misbehaving this day and the weather was creating the worst possible lighting which had me doing nothing short of dancing around trying to keep up and capture the right moments.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that I made the wrappers from scratch. I’ve never seen egg roll or wonton wrappers in the stores here so I didn’t have much choice but even if you can buy them I recommend trying them at home at least once. You know, just to say you did.
