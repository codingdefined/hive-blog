Delicious #71 : Murray's Deli at Atlantis, the 1950's style New York-style restaurant!","author":"sweetsssj","created":"July 12, 2017","permlink":"miss-delicious-71-murray-s-deli-at-atlantis-the-1950-s-style-new-york-style-restaurant","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bObivF/IMG_9706.jpg\n\nAs I mentioned before, the Atlantis resort has no shortage of food to delight our tummies, for those of us who are feeling particularly hungry, a visit to [Poseidon's Table](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-68-poseidon-s-table-a-restaurant-worthy-of-gods) for an all-you-can-eat dining experience worthy of Gods is in order. \n\nOthers who feel the need to munch at night time may prefer a visit to [Olives](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-73-a-look-at-the-atlantis-casino-from-a-non-gambler) inside the casino. If you're feeling lucky or have come off a lucky win, then why not dine to celebrate?\n\nFor those of us who prefer some local style cuisine, look no further than a visit to [Bimini Road at Marina Village](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-65-the-hidden-gem-in-atlantis-the-marina-village-and-the-bimini-road-restaurant-photos-video), here I was introduced to the remarkable local Red Snapper, a fish that I now look out for each and every time I dine out. \n\nWe also had the opportunity to get into the nitty gritty with [Virgils BBQ](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-70-virgil-s-real-bbq-at-atlantis), a top 10 Southern style BBQ restaurant with hands down some of the best background views in all of Atlantis. The food was on point too, who could resist a serving of oak wood barbecued ribs? I certainly couldn't. \n\n\n\n![murrays.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUvmStgERpk5EhwmaDH75E89hd9xtvo8PcEwUrBxBXnZE/murrays.png)\nSo, today we'll be visiting the food option that many of you will resonate well with. A walk along the front side of Atlantis before leading to Marina village gives us a splendid view of both the Royal Towers and the large yacht dock where many super yachts are parked no doubt to enjoy a day at Atlantis. \n\nI wanted something quick, easy and filling, and I thought to myself what could beat an American New York style diner?\nI made my way through the gigantic building, to the front of the building and walked alongside the Yacht dock to find ***Murray's Deli***. A New York style deli right in the heart of Atlantis. \n\nSince many visitors of Atlantis come from America, they will never feel too far away from home - atleast when it comes to eating familiar foods from their home. For me, New York style food is definitely not the kind of food I eat at home, so it is a welcome experience as any.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gNpLaF/IMG_8111.jpg\nJust opposite our food destination is the harbour / port where you'll see a neat row of absolutely stunning Yachts. Since seeing the Charisma Yacht in my journeys to Exuma, I still dream of owning one of these one day. At least have the pleasure of island hoping around the Bahamas on one!\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jTK8Ua/IMG_8032.jpg\n\nAnd here we are at ***Murray's Deli***. The entrance has a large statue of an Italian looking waiter. Strangely, the desk at the front is actually for paying the bill and not for reserving a table. I queued up for 10 minutes to find that out..\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/huoz2v/DSC00982.jpg\n\nFurther inside, there is a lovely high top table just in front of the open plan kitchen. Diners wishing to see how their food is prepared can sit up close and not wait for the waiter to bring the food to their table.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/in73Ua/DSC00987.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cGBaaF/DSC00998.jpg\n\nLong rows of tables form the usual seating arrangement. There is very little space between each table which suggests that dining close quarters is welcome and probably quite frequent!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ehkq9a/DSC00983.jpg\n\nOn one end of the bar, there is a bakery which has a lovely selection of cakes and desserts which you can pick up yourself, and even take away.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ddnsNv/DSC00999.jpg\n\nAll of the tables also use a multi-coloured sofa as seats. Some are circular, whilst others just follow the lines of the restaurant tables. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iMMcNv/IMG_8042.jpg\n\nI really like this wooden palm tree behind the waiter.  It's a lovely carved design and doubles up as a decorative lighting fixture. \n\n![IMG_8109.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf6iDZe7z6NvBeE8Gg5uGkxf1xG57Uxj2RPDe6YC2ykR9/IMG_8109.jpg)\n\nLike with most diners, the sauces such as Heinz Tomato Ketchup, Mayonnaise, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper and Mustard are provided on the table for you to garnish your food as you wish. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iDY2pa/IMG_8037.jpg\n\nThis is the menu which has a picture of downtown New York on the front and it's signature Yellow taxis!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gH2HNv/IMG_8036.jpg\n\nAs you can see from the *Menu*, ***Murray's Deli*** specialises in deli sandwiches.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/h2nTUa/IMG_8041.jpg\n\nThey also have a nice selection of Desserts and Sundaes.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jZZ8Ua/IMG_8040.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fJcTUa/IMG_8039.jpg\n\nI was surprised to see *Dr Browns Cream Soda* on the drinks menu. In my very limited experience of drinking Cream Soda, I've always loved it very much. With the temperature outside averaging 35 degrees Celsius, this was a much needed refreshment.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jnoP2v/IMG_8043.jpg\n\nAlong with the refreshing Cream Soda, I ordered the ***Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad***. I must say, I am extremely impressed with not only the fresh taste of the lettuce, but also the generous serving of grilled chicken. I could probably be happy with just this salad honestly!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jqua9a/IMG_8050.jpg\nNext up, the main! \n\n***Club Atlantean Bacon Sandwich served on a bed of fries***.  How could anyone resist such delicious Bacon and freshly fried fries? Again, the serving of Bacon was very generous, it was so delicious that I decided to eat it on it's own without the bread. \nhttp://image.ibb.co/bWwcNv/IMG_8105.jpg\n\n***Murray's Big Beef Dip***. The most meaty choice for beef lovers. This sandwich is served with Provolone cheese, sliced roast beef and beef gravy. What I liked most about this dish was the gravy which had such a rich taste of beef. The cheese was getting a little overwhelming so the gravy helped balance it out quite alot!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gwaF9a/IMG_8108.jpg\n\nFood is one of life's guilty pleasures. On this day, I feel no what guilt whatsoever. Good food comes in all shapes and sizes and Murray's Deli does not fail to impress!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hnua9a/IMG_9708.jpg\n\nThank you for joining me on a tour of Atlantis' very own New York style deli. Now you have no excuse to be missing food from home. I certainly didn't and I don't even eat this stuff regularly!\n\nStay tuned for the next edition of Miss. Delicious!

We believe the ecosystem of the whole platform will not be developed sustainably unless developers productivity could be promoted. Asch is also an open platform whose focus is not limited to a particular area, such as finance, document storage, or copywrite proof, but is on providing a series of underlying and abstract APIs, which can be combined and utilized to realize almost all kinds of applications. In addition Asch system utilized enhenced DPOS agorithm in its consensus mechanism to significantly reduce the probability of block fork and the risk of duplicate payment.
