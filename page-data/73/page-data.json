Then there would be a VAT at the next point of sale - i.e. when the tyre is sold to the dealership and then to the consumer and so on. \n\nUnder the new taxation regime fruits, vegetables, pulses, wheat, bread and rice are exempted from taxation even as chips, biscuits, butter, tea and coffee are attracting higher taxes.

My post was about a common newcomer question and how I respond to it. I used the question as my title. Someone with a lot of influence flagged my post and left an angry comment that my hypothetical was silly. I wholeheartedly agree with his comment, the question is silly. But none the less its a question I’ve been asked a lot over 5 years of pitching bitcoin to friends and family. I’ve seen Max Keiser talk about it, I’ve read it in many popular blogs in various ways. The post was nothing special, but still took me 20 mins or so to put together and comment on the first comments I received.\n\nI have replied to the person who flagged me and politely asked what I’ve done wrong and how to avoid it. . . Although before I understood he was actually angry, I made an earlier reply where I laughed along with the flagger’s comment about my silly title. Potentially pissing him off further incidentally. Also, at first I used an image of a book and lantern from Pinterest, but thinking that might have been the issue, switched it to an image from pixabay which I know is public domain. Honestly not sure if I did something against the rules, bad etiquette, that the person didn’t like my title, or they read it fully and just didn’t like my post altogether.\n\nAny help on how to proceed is greatly appreciated! :)\n\n\n1) Should I further attempt to contact the person who flagged me and/or delete my potentially misconstrued comment? I’ve been able to see that they have moved on to other posts and didn’t reply to me.\n\n2) Is it possible to spend money in some way to make my post visible again? I spent $100 worth of SBD on promotion that seemed to have no effect on views at all. Spent another $50 promoting this one in the hopes that some people with knowledge/influence can give me some tips.\n\n3) Would It make sense to maybe alter my post a little and try to repost it? Ultimately this seems to me to be a bad option as I would not be contributing valuable content if I’m just repeating myself. Not sure if this is advisable and could make the influential person even angrier to attack other posts of mine.\n\nAt then end of the day I really really want to use Steem and get into it, but its tough if things I spend time on aren’t visible. I can’t even share the flagged post on my other social media sites like I usually would. Im no scammer or spammer. I’ve been writing about cryptos for years on social media and would like to contribute thoughtful content.

It seems that SteemDB and chainBB do not have any official logos. The logos shown above are designed by @stevenlwk)\n\n---\n\n<center><h2>A small trick</h2></center>\n\nSwitching between these 4 platforms is not a convenient task; I used to do a lot of clickings before I can arrive at the corresponding platform. But soon I discovered a slightly more convenient trick: <b><i>you can just edit the domain of the URL of the current page to jump to any other platforms!</i></b> (If you already knew this trick, you may skip to the next section)\n\nFor example, say I am browsing this post on <b><i>steemit.com</i></b>, which has a URL https://steemit.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z.  \nObserve the following table to see the corresponding links on these platforms:\n\nPlatform | Link\n---|---\nSteemit| <a href=\"https://steemit.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemit</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nchainBB| <a href=\"https://beta.chainbb.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>beta.chainbb</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nSteemD| <a href=\"https://steemd.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemd</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\nSteemDB| <a href=\"https://steemdb.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z\">https://<b>steemdb</b>.com/contest/@kenchung/free-steem-mathematics-programming-competition-2-2017624t152846454z</a>\n\nIt is not difficult to discover that the only difference between the URLs is their domain names.\n\n---\n<center><h2>Our new tool</h2></center>\n\nUsing the little trick stated can save some time, but can still be quite annoying to change back and forth continuously. Thanks to the idea proposed by my friend @happychau123, we have developed a simple Chrome extension which makes platform switching just two clicks away! What the extension does is replacing the domain in the URL by your desired one. Now you have more time to create quality contents :)\n\n<center><h3>Get <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steemit-switcher/dmgjhbjipbimionibbgobckinffdeanj\"><strong>Steemit Platform Switcher</strong></a> now on Chrome Web Store!</h3></center>\n\n<center>![post logo banner.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPHjau3twj7E5zZ2qx42WWAM7weqDrUqQGza5b2cXKtEL/post%20logo%20banner.png)</center>\n\n---\n<center><h2>How to use</h2></center>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/steemit-switcher/dmgjhbjipbimionibbgobckinffdeanj\">Click here </a>to navigate to Chrome Web Store, press <i>ADD TO CHROME</i>.</li>\n\n<center>![web storepng.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmfB6zbzDq7rZedFNwBW6uNUntTNy46ocsaut4MJK7ZZEe/web%20storepng.png)</center>\n\n<li>Press <i>Add extension</i>.</li>\n\n<center>![add ext.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeDm3bqcYYN27pHCx93wZe67N1tSmnAe64EpGUxhhHiiq/add%20ext.png)</center>\n\n<li>Make sure this message pops up.</li>\n\n<center>![added.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPpT9xxE8s7f95Af4zM41kMfv2Mk82eTZrfh7Yqa5fJaM/added.png)</center>\n\n<li>Navigate to any steemit posts on any one of the 4 platforms.</li>\n\n<li>Click the extension button.

If you encounter a similar problem, try to switch to another tab and then switch back. This should solve most of the problems. We are working on it and will provide an update ASAP.\n\n---\n\n<h3>Steemit Platform Switcher is completely free to use.
