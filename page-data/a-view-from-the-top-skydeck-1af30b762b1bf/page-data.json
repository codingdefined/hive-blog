It was a party organised by the Office in terms of Diwali. It was nice restaurant but the best thing was the view, it was outstanding, spectacular etc etc. \n\nI would not say it was on too much height, but being on 15th floor it was really cool. A nice wind were flowing which makes it a nice combination with food and drinks. \n\nSome of the photos :\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/pb4fwf0cnb.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/02lvwjp6hh.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/rm4z6vg9fu.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/bd95i4baiv.jpg)","created":"November 04, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A View from the Top - SkyDeck","permlink":"a-view-from-the-top-skydeck-1af30b762b1bf","previous":{"title":"Festivity All Around","permlink":"festivity-all-around-dc8385da11e1b"},"next":{"title":"A Happy Diwali","permlink":"a-happy-diwali-384a7ae415952"}}}}
