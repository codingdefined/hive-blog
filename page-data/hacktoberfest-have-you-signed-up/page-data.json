Whether youâ€™re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or the company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.\n\nThe rules are simple, you just need to create 4 PRs (Pull Request) in any of the open-source repo and thus you are entitled to receive limited edition Hacktoberfest t-shirt. Do note that only the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will get a t-shirt.\n\nOnce you complete 4 PRs, you need to wait for another 7 days for the review period. Once the review period is over you will be officially complete the challenge to get a t-shirt and swag.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVqaaDiyHDr97MHoUMBTMZhxmpQPYV4hHhsWfV4VQq9nj/image.png)\n\nMany companies joined the celebration by rewarding their contributors with even more swag which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/benbarth/hacktoberfest-swag/blob/master/README.md).\n\nNow the question arises why you should contribute, it's not only for the t-shirt you will earn. We use a lot of open-source software in our daily life (steem being one), by contributing we are just giving back to the community. \n\nIf you want to start and looking for a project, do let me know. I will help you find a project.","created":"October 10, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Hacktoberfest - Have you signed up?","permlink":"hacktoberfest-have-you-signed-up","previous":{"title":"A Day trip to Shravanabelagola","permlink":"a-day-trip-to-shravanabelagola"},"next":{"title":"Costly Dental Clinic","permlink":"costly-dental-clinic"}}}}
