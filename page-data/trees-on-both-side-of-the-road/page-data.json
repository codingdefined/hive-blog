But unfortunately it is not the case for most part of the world. There are big cities where you get big buildings and have hardly any sign of trees. I also stay in a big city but whenever I get time I will escape to get some fresh air. \n\nRecently I was going out of the city where I have seen trees on both side of the Road, which makes travel so smooth and refreshing. I was wondering, if this can be done all over the world where we can plant trees on the road side which will help the environment big time.\n\n![IMG_20180101_160027.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNi3CyNHFWFhBswsvJbEjHbWB2Pcx5cdb5LEq7JXeCxMN/IMG_20180101_160027.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20180101_160029.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUqkSbXd8Ly6UJJhNAun8RZApcFMG3UD54RovsFJwrSKw/IMG_20180101_160029.jpg)","created":"January 13, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Trees on both side of the Road","permlink":"trees-on-both-side-of-the-road","previous":{"title":"Utopian Moderator Intro - CodingDefined","permlink":"utopian-moderator-intro-codingdefined"},"next":{"title":"[SmartphonePhotography] Mighty Waves in the Sea","permlink":"smartphonephotography-mighty-waves-in-the-sea"}}}}
