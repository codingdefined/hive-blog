Low or No payout is not the reason to think that your effort to this community is just a waste of time.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSTZfkoqWfEdyX2uT6mR3AZz2fbetbvsNoGQPYLTZ4jej/image.png)\n> [image source](http://dustinmaherfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-Dont-give-up.jpg)\n\n# On this article, I wanna summarised to you the 7 reasons why you should stop to think about giving up on Steemit... As briefly as possible... \n\n## 1. Steemit wasn't a burden, it's an enjoyable thing to do with your free time and if we earned - just a bonus.\n\nIf it wasn't to Steemit I could not imagine myself writing to add values to other. I wasn't even a writer or have any experience on blogging before Steemit. Given that English is not my first language, however, I could not resist the joy and excitement whenever I see and read other peoples blog. My little innocent mind is poured in every knowledge that I have read all the time that I spent in this wonderful community. Earning is just a little bonus from the community.\n\nhttp://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg\n> [image source](http://images.clipartpanda.com/happy-computer-user-Happy-Computer.jpg)\n\n## 2. Too many things to discover.\n\nIt's an awesome thing that I learned so much right from the very start when I created an account, it was like an endless learning. The more I read the more I am aware that I don't know anything. Every blog has all something in common denominator which is to add values to their readers not only that but also if you read also the comment like I always do. You will notice you gained more values that the community will benefit from it, every experience that shared of every steemians.\n\nEvery time other steemian posts about travel it feels like you're travelling too. Whenever they share the experience what it feels like to be in the classy restaurant and food looks really good it feels the same way right in very front of your computer. Good reasons that low payout doesn't stop you.\n\nhttp://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg\n> [image source](http://www.seaadventurethailand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cliff-Jumping-Adventure-Main-2--1500x630.jpg)\n\n## 3. Gaining more experience.\n\nI remembered a good verse in the bible that written in 1 Corinthians 10:11 ***\"Now all these things happened unto them for examples:\"***. Reading other person experience is a way better to learn. Like a great blog shared @lukestokes about his article [how he loss money on trading](https://steemit.com/hero/@lukestokes/i-got-margin-called-on-hero-today-things-don-t-always-go-up) being a good example to us. Other people experiences gives so much advantages even if we hardly see a dollar in our pending payouts sections.\n\nhttps://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png\n> [image source](https://legacy.hackerexperience.com/images/og.png)\n\n## 4. Blogging brings you awesome memories.\n\nHave you read the white paper on Steem? Are you aware that all we have created here on Steemit would remain in the blockchain and will not be deleted as long as internet and blockchain exist? This is the few reasons that low/no payout doesn't discourage you from creating valuable content. It creates wacky and memorable memory of you and me right on the blockchain. I feel way better on it than day trading on exchanges because it doesn't leave any mark to you and to the community, meanwhile, blogging is making yourself more valueble to others by putting your effort creating a good content.\n\n Imagine our great grandchild have a chance to see your article in the future because of the awesome technology we are using on Steem. They would feel very proud of you for the values and effort you have given out. Even if you didn't talk to them personally, however, on this article as if you are speaking to them, telling not to give up as well from what they persue in their life. Just what like you are showing them right now.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg\n> [image source](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/87/05/2e/87052edd3381aa570f7b2f822adda021.jpg)\n\n## 5. You become more adaptable to the new technology.\n\nThis thing is revolutionary but I admit it to myself even I studied computer programming still have a hard time to grasp all things we need to learn inside. But before we knew it, we become more internet player because of continues blogging and engaging with this society. We used the Markdown and HTML codes often to enhance our writing, little we know we improve a lot compared to the time we created our very first blog. Learning gives us so much that it will serve us for many years to come in which I value more than $$$.\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg\n> [image source](https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/4dc5e09/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F73%2Fd1c80053f197d2ba5d09881425bed4%2F42371WideModern_BusinesswomanPhone_053113.jpg)\n\n## 6. You grow and thinking a lot in a tremendous way.\n\nThe mind is the greatest asset we had, not the stocks, nor the house, or Bitcoin. Our mind is our greatest asset of all. This tiny thing between our ears is what we need to nourish every time to create more asset. When we create a blog this little tiny thing is put to work. Like a muscle in our body, it grows bigger and bigger every time we used it. This thing can do so much, more than what we could have imagined. By blogging, we tremendously increased our mental capacity by thinking ***what is a great blog that the community will benefit more?*** By reading the blog and trying to add a valuable comment, this brain is put to work every time. \n\nhttps://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6\n> [image source](https://mms-us.com/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/field/image/growth-fixed-brains-2-new.png?itok=zJgdeRd6)\n\n## 7. On Steemit, the best is yet to come...\n\nAs long as we are in this awesome community, this place has so much space to grow. Did you listen to @jerrybanfield? [Steemit will possibly reach $10 per token in just 10 months or even more according to him](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jerrybanfield/10-reasons-for-usd10-steem-price-in-10-months). So many things to come especially to the upcoming Hard Fork 20 Velocity that has the plan to surpass the Reddit platform, could you imagine what would the Hard Fork 30 or Hard Fork 40 would bring to us in the near future? So many exciting things to come for us inside of the Steemit Platform. Hold on, buckle up and relax because it gonna be a bumpy ride going to Andromeda galaxy with Steem!
