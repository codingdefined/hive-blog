It is so much required in this era to set your goals be it anything. You can start the goals as small as possible.

But why like an Eagle? Have you ever noticed an Eagle when it is waiting. They seem to be so majestic, poised and elegant when they patiently wait and scan the horizon. Now the real question is what Eagle does different.\n\n**Being Focus** - Eagles have the tremendous ability to be focus on things what matters the most to them and just ignore what does not matter to them.\n\n**Confidence in achieving something**- They seem to be the most confident when they see an opportunity. They know they will get success no matter what happens and they do not get anxious or frustrated easily.\n\n**Strong Foundation** - Eagle always try to strengthen their foundation thus giving them the advantage of sailing through whatever storm comes into their way.\n\nSo if you are not like an Eagle in any situation be it looking out for a new job, or getting the college admission or even getting a good post payout here in Steemit then my suggestion would become an Eagle. Turn into an Eagle, you will sail through your goals easily.\n\n## **Upvote, Follow, Resteem** [**@codingdefined**](https://steemit.com/@codingdefined)","json_metadata":"{\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"motivation\",\"life\",\"blog\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"http:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-sa\\/4.0\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/@codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/upload.wikimedia.org\\/wikipedia\\/commons\\/a\\/ad\\/The_eagle_says-_%22look_at_tha_boootey%22.jpg\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"634c53df-f81d-5bd5-a7e6-95dc4b1ae6a8","title":"Can art be expensive?","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 04, 2017","permlink":"can-art-be-expensive","body":"Yesterday I went to an art show to SR Kalimat Art Exhibition in UB City Bangalore.

But stress is not always bad. Some stresses helps us to get going and are good for us (as I said the good or the bad, can be ugly too). \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbGysLXmFnjwCjvLb8zXzQv7L5EDvzB7sHAR3AffDLNrU/image.png)\nImage from Pixabay\n\nThe Stress response is the body’s way of protecting us. When we work properly it helps us to stay focused, energetic and alert. Stress helps us to put the brakes to avoid an accident, thus we can say it also helps us to save our lives. These are the good parts of the stress.\n\nWhen we are stressed our blood pressure rises, breathing becomes more rapid, heart rate rises and muscles become tense. For me the most common symptoms of stress is that I not able to sleep, during my engineering I can hardly sleep for 2 hours before the exams. \n\nWhat's stressful for me may be quite different from what's stressful to someone else. For example, I get terrified on getting up in front of people and speak (in a toasmaste session), whereas most of the people I know do it at ease. Someone performs extremely well under pressure while someone shuts down when work demands escalate. Stress is difficult to define as it is so different for each of us. A good example can be observing people in a steep roller coaster ride some people enjoys it a lot whereas some shuts their eyes and waiting it to be over as soon as possible. \n\nSo, my question to all of you **Was the roller coaster ride stressful?**\n\nThe conditions and pressures that purpose stress is referred to as stressors. We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as an exhausting work schedule or a rocky relationship. But, whatever that places excessive needs on you or forces you to regulate may be stressful. This consists of advantageous activities consisting of getting married, shopping for a house, going to university, or receiving a promotion.\n\n### There are mainly four types of stresses\n###\n•\tEustress – It is a short term stress which provides immediate strength.\n•\tDistress - Distress is a negative stress brought about by constant readjustments or alterations in a routine.\n•\tHyper stress – Hyper stress occurs when an individual is pushed beyond how much you can handle.\n•\tHypo stress - Hypo stress occurs when an individual is bored or unchallenged. \n\n### How to reduce the stress at work.\n\n1.\tRecognize warning signs of excessive stress at work which can be due to trouble concentrating, losing interest on work.\n2.\tReduce work stress by taking care of yourself by having good food, doing exercise.\n3.\tReduce job stress by organizing and planning beforehand, so that you will not get extra pressure on last minute.\n4.\tYou can even approach managers or employers to get assistance of how they manage their work stress.\n\n### You can even remember four A’s to manage your stress. And that is \n###\n\nAvoid i.e. Avoid Unnecessary Stress,\nAlter i.e. Alter the situation, \nAdapt i.e. Adapt to the Situation and \nAccept i.e. Accept the things you cannot change.\n\n“God will never give you anything you can’t handle, so don’t stress”.\n\n## Upvote, Follow, Resteem @codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"stress\",\"writing\",\"life\",\"blog\",\"voiceshares\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmbGysLXmFnjwCjvLb8zXzQv7L5EDvzB7sHAR3AffDLNrU\\/image.png\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"4178a02d-5dd5-5f74-a620-8299e2d9a73a","title":"📷 #ColorChallenge FridayBlue - Highest Peak in Mount Abu","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 01, 2017","permlink":"colorchallenge-fridayblue-highest-peak-in-mount-abu","body":"Guru Shikhar is the highest point in Mount Abu and the view from there is amazing.

I will choose the winner on Saturday and delegate 500 Steem Power to a lucky Steemian for the month of September.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Everyone will be eligible so comment away (you can even recommend some of your Steemian friends) 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</p>\n<p>If I get tons of engagement on this post, I might be able to do this once a week... depending how many people respond to this giveaway 😎</p>\n<p>The winner will be announced on Saturday.
