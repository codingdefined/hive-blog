It is appropriate for me too say that depression is like an illness where it takes all the energy and pleasure out from you. There are many thing that can lead you to depression. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmegGgkgVMhYJVtXEgofZ8a9PAWyDGgM45TausQHLymQqB/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/p-242024/?no_redirect![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXTyRmk85Sc7vvfpkCjBLodneGJN8Hhgdekz3Ycv1BDX6/image.png))\n\nIn this post we will figure out what are the main habits that leads you to depression.\n<hr>\n\n**1 : Lack of Exercise -** Do you aware of how much important is exercise for our body, not only physical but also for your mental health. Have you ever gone for a walk in the evening or in the morning, there is so much energy outside that will make you feel alive. Staying in home all day and not doing any physical activity can lead to depression. \n\nYou will become lazy and become oversize which again can lead to depression becuase it will reduce the confidence you have in yourself. \n\n**To come out of depression -** The simple remedy of coming out of depression is to start exercise. I am not telling you to go and hit the gym and become a bodybuilder. But a casual walk in the morning or evening can make a monumental difference if you are suffering from depression.\n\n<hr>\n\n**2 : Sleeping Habits -** If you have a poor sleeping habits then that situation is ideal for depression. It is necessary for human body to get atleast 7 hours sleep daily. That does not mean that you should sleep anytime and make that 7 hours, you should have a proper sleeping routine. Lack of sleep will make you agitated thus eventually leads you to depression. Again if you are stressed you will not get the sleep you want.\n\n**To come out of depression -** Sleep at least 7-8 hours daily with proper routine like 10 PM sleep and 6 AM wakeup. If you take enough rest your mind is always clear and then it helps you to reduce the stress as well.\n\n<hr>\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmS6Lqdj4XuDRrQbofbNdaUhN5wyarnYUz8ZS8ckbfycCE/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/p-689453/?no_redirect)\n\n**3 : Isolation State -** Keeping oneself in Isolation is one more habit of getting depressed. When you start avoiding friends and family, then you are getting into a situation which is ideal for depression. It is worst thing for an individual to be alone or to be isolated.\n\n**To come out of depression -** Talk to friends and families atleat once a day. Talk about all the positive thing happen in a day, it is always important to be connected with other people no matter whatever situation you are in.\n\n<hr>\n\n**4 : Dont' think too much -** Negative thinking about anything is the major cause of depression. It is like a cancer to keep thinking about whatever has happened. See, you cannot change anything whatever has happened but by over-thinking about that you are doing more damage to yourself. These things are out of your control and by just thinking you cannot change it and eventually it will make you depressed. \n\n**To come out of depression -** Always try to redirect your attention to more positive things in your life than the things you cannot change. If you cannot ignore the fact, then what you should write whatever you have in mind and flush it. It will make you feel better.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"depression\",\"life\",\"health\",\"voiceshares\",\"psychology\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmegGgkgVMhYJVtXEgofZ8a9PAWyDGgM45TausQHLymQqB\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmS6Lqdj4XuDRrQbofbNdaUhN5wyarnYUz8ZS8ckbfycCE\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/p-242024\\/?no_redirect![](https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmXTyRmk85Sc7vvfpkCjBLodneGJN8Hhgdekz3Ycv1BDX6\\/image.png)\",\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/p-689453\\/?no_redirect\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"e57f00ea-e2c0-5803-9efb-49e4084d5060","title":"Udaipur Sunset","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 06, 2017","permlink":"udaipur-sunset","body":"# <center> This is my first entry to the Sunset Contest by @juliank</center>\n<hr>\n\n# <center>Sunset at Udaipur, Rajasthan, India</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQCFZ5ahBfFwEDRv4pR81EMfDF94wMY4poUAqG6vKnTKZ/IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center> Camera - Mobile Camera (Motorola X Play, 21 MP)</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n##### <center> Follow @codingdefined </center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"sunsetcontest\",\"photography\",\"contest\",\"nature\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"juliank\",\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQCFZ5ahBfFwEDRv4pR81EMfDF94wMY4poUAqG6vKnTKZ\\/IMG_20170301_182850802.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b724d1d2-4e5f-54a7-950c-5efeb703f642","title":"B&W Photo Contest: Food - Indian Meal - 1st Entry","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 05, 2017","permlink":"b-and-w-photo-contest-food-indian-meal-1st-entry","body":"# <center> This is my first entry to the B&W Photo Contest by @daveks and Judged by @gringalicious</center>\n<hr>\n\n# <center>Indian Meal - Puri, Chana, Banana Chips and Halwa</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170905_082527-2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPNx9WFhkqsjSLY2d91DWZ7nGS3JrFXto3PU4oq1UzCtM/IMG_20170905_082527-2.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center> Camera - Nokia 6 Back Camera, 16 MP</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center> \"When I stopped eating meat, I fell in love with East Indian food - there's so much selection, and they use the most beautiful spices.\" - Laura Mennell </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n##### <center> Upvote, Follow, Resteem @codingdefined </center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"bwphotocontest\",\"photography\",\"food\",\"photo\",\"art\"],\"users\":[\"daveks\",\"gringalicious\",\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmPNx9WFhkqsjSLY2d91DWZ7nGS3JrFXto3PU4oq1UzCtM\\/IMG_20170905_082527-2.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b46123ab-c194-5028-9b85-46f919252923","title":"📷 #ColorChallenge Tuesday Orange - Sunset","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 05, 2017","permlink":"colorchallenge-tuesday-orange-sunset","body":"My entry for the ColorChallenge by @kalemandra\n\nI have clicked few pictures of the sunset at Indiranagar, Bangalore, India.

But why like an Eagle? Have you ever noticed an Eagle when it is waiting. They seem to be so majestic, poised and elegant when they patiently wait and scan the horizon. Now the real question is what Eagle does different.\n\n**Being Focus** - Eagles have the tremendous ability to be focus on things what matters the most to them and just ignore what does not matter to them.\n\n**Confidence in achieving something**- They seem to be the most confident when they see an opportunity. They know they will get success no matter what happens and they do not get anxious or frustrated easily.\n\n**Strong Foundation** - Eagle always try to strengthen their foundation thus giving them the advantage of sailing through whatever storm comes into their way.\n\nSo if you are not like an Eagle in any situation be it looking out for a new job, or getting the college admission or even getting a good post payout here in Steemit then my suggestion would become an Eagle.

This post is dedicated to all people who love plants and would like to continue working to give them the space they require. \n\nSo what plants give us, the answer would be Oxygen. But it will not wrong to say that it also increases the humidity in the environment thus helps in rain to some extent. Have you ever played or walked in the park, isn't your mood get refreshed automatically. This is because of the plants in the park, they help to improve the mood and health to all the people who spend their time near them.  Thus I have talked the necessary things which plants actually give, but there are so many things plants gives us whether its food, paper etc.\n\nHave we given anything to the plant? Just think about it.\n\nYesterday I was going through the road and I found an interesting thing. There was a Tulsi plant which was almost dead but before dying also they have given the world something as beautiful as oneself and that is a baby plant.\n\nThe original dead tulsi plant.\n\n![IMG_20170902_170604.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQGK71Ah59ZzPDQSJfzMwuXB24Ee53S4Ni3KWEFecruKs/IMG_20170902_170604.jpg)\n\nThe baby tulsi plant\n\n![IMG_20170902_170610.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNcVpXiXxiLop7tYCvx2pX2yGBRFCfsjyusqkspkKLzm7/IMG_20170902_170610.jpg)\n\nAnd they are not alone, they are so many of them.\n\n### One thing I learn yesterday that \"Plants are the Universal / Ultimate Giver\".

But stress is not always bad. Some stresses helps us to get going and are good for us (as I said the good or the bad, can be ugly too). \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmbGysLXmFnjwCjvLb8zXzQv7L5EDvzB7sHAR3AffDLNrU/image.png)\nImage from Pixabay\n\nThe Stress response is the body’s way of protecting us. When we work properly it helps us to stay focused, energetic and alert. Stress helps us to put the brakes to avoid an accident, thus we can say it also helps us to save our lives. These are the good parts of the stress.\n\nWhen we are stressed our blood pressure rises, breathing becomes more rapid, heart rate rises and muscles become tense. For me the most common symptoms of stress is that I not able to sleep, during my engineering I can hardly sleep for 2 hours before the exams. \n\nWhat's stressful for me may be quite different from what's stressful to someone else. For example, I get terrified on getting up in front of people and speak (in a toasmaste session), whereas most of the people I know do it at ease. Someone performs extremely well under pressure while someone shuts down when work demands escalate. Stress is difficult to define as it is so different for each of us. A good example can be observing people in a steep roller coaster ride some people enjoys it a lot whereas some shuts their eyes and waiting it to be over as soon as possible. \n\nSo, my question to all of you **Was the roller coaster ride stressful?**\n\nThe conditions and pressures that purpose stress is referred to as stressors. We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as an exhausting work schedule or a rocky relationship. But, whatever that places excessive needs on you or forces you to regulate may be stressful. This consists of advantageous activities consisting of getting married, shopping for a house, going to university, or receiving a promotion.\n\n### There are mainly four types of stresses\n###\n•\tEustress – It is a short term stress which provides immediate strength.\n•\tDistress - Distress is a negative stress brought about by constant readjustments or alterations in a routine.\n•\tHyper stress – Hyper stress occurs when an individual is pushed beyond how much you can handle.\n•\tHypo stress - Hypo stress occurs when an individual is bored or unchallenged. \n\n### How to reduce the stress at work.\n\n1.\tRecognize warning signs of excessive stress at work which can be due to trouble concentrating, losing interest on work.\n2.\tReduce work stress by taking care of yourself by having good food, doing exercise.\n3.\tReduce job stress by organizing and planning beforehand, so that you will not get extra pressure on last minute.\n4.\tYou can even approach managers or employers to get assistance of how they manage their work stress.\n\n### You can even remember four A’s to manage your stress. And that is \n###\n\nAvoid i.e. Avoid Unnecessary Stress,\nAlter i.e. Alter the situation, \nAdapt i.e. Adapt to the Situation and \nAccept i.e. Accept the things you cannot change.\n\n“God will never give you anything you can’t handle, so don’t stress”.\n\n## Upvote, Follow, Resteem @codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"stress\",\"writing\",\"life\",\"blog\",\"voiceshares\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmbGysLXmFnjwCjvLb8zXzQv7L5EDvzB7sHAR3AffDLNrU\\/image.png\"]}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":490,"numPages":75,"currentPage":50}}}
