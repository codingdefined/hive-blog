The initial goal of Steemit, which was to reward quality content was defeated in the sense that, creators of absolutely great content weren't recognized, and really cool talents were ignored. This major problem was the bane that stirred up the idea, creation, and finally, the development of Knacksteem. Talents and skills would never go unrecognized and unrewarded. The organization of Knacksteem makes this possible.\n\nSource: https://steemit.com/knacksteem/@harry-heightz/knacksteem-the-new-den-of-talents-on-steem-blockchaingeneral-overview-and-personal-opinions-ideas-id-7dya4bjgagg\n\n### New Features - Implemented Voting Slider for Upvoting and Downvoting a Post\n\nIn my previous post I have only implemented Upvote and Downvote which will send 100% weight. So the task pending was to implement the Voting Slider, thus implemented the Voting Slider based on which the weight will be send for upvoting or downvoting as shown below. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmex3UgiHZEEhpb9iP9dH7mj8JxLgkmqSjEkR2eEbLviY8/image.png)\n\nCommits : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/93/commits/43bce09677464c14e5314c7620a5495f36b1137d\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSVuFmhdU9xP4g7JQ5U2KuP5T8pRMDQ1HzDKTVAYnnjVw/image.png)\n\n### New Features - Implemented Scoring Slider for Scoring Contributions by Moderators\n\nWe have used the same Voting Slider which we have used for Upvoting and Downvoting to score the Contributions for Moderators. This is actually better because then we do not have to recreate our component and use the same component.\n\nCommits : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/102/commits/b99b73c01407ec5672dc7b43b24e637dd252adf1\n\n### New Features - Showing KNT Tokens\n\nThough it was a small feature but now users can see their KNT tokens from their profile\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPkcpEbmMz6nfNzM6RGCes1vi5C5ZUg1eVn7XgEfdT9Rt/image.png)\n\nCommits : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/101/commits/b59077333e4085bf7d83b3df604e4035dfb116cb\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmaM1hTaSs1BWH7HNqBehDbmwiPjj5GRarLboMMjqQsVRX/image.png)\n\n### GitHub Account\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined","created":"February 11, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Voting Slider and Scoring Slider Added to KnackSteem","permlink":"voting-slider-and-scoring-slider-added-to-knacksteem","previous":{"title":"Downvoting, Upvoting, Guidelines Added to KnackSteem","permlink":"downvoting-upvoting-guidelines-added-to-knacksteem"},"next":{"title":"GitHub Pull Request Showing Commits which are already on the Target Branch","permlink":"github-pull-request-showing-commits-which-are-already-on-the-target-branch"}}}}
