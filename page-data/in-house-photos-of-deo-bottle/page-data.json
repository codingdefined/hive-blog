So done some productive work like cleaning the house, preparing food rather than ordering and then some in-house photography of the Deo bottles. All the photos are taken on my new Canon Lens 24mm, f2.8. Its been a week and I am already loving it. This being my first prime lens, and it was totally worth it. \n\n![IMG_1983.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTVh2yY8cgDbLVAYpsAZhB9wVhSQumvptC9RzqfwZ7BnN)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1979.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNNCRDrgNQ5nphVi2QfPiceaQMcZJKavEP3rHujUM3wLZ)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1986.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmV5TT8nje5CCm3k7cFZmf3nLTKDqAPMXZRHj2f9ThVpwW)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1987.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYT3rzqvpw7wGvSJ9s1L2uVQ3cH2DUhUeTXCa6Qj6CZjZ)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1991.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPpfRdd4uJzxWuxPmDxmtyKYsSSRvprtPCR9PQ8PGURun)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1996.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmRvTxzRCRF43MzEsieS7jZz1gEVhfe2wuKJxCom7ssjdB)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_1998.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVtCkQdXR6DkErakhqkJNSwiwARrHL4efNzmCvU7TMCSB)\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n","created":"October 20, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"In House Photos of Deo Bottle","permlink":"in-house-photos-of-deo-bottle","previous":{"title":"Paper Books replacement","permlink":"paper-books-replacement"},"next":{"title":"A Simple bug turns out to be a Night Mare","permlink":"a-simple-bug-turns-out-to-be-a-night-mare"}}}}
