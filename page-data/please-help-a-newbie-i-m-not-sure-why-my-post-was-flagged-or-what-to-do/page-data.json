My post was about a common newcomer question and how I respond to it. I used the question as my title. Someone with a lot of influence flagged my post and left an angry comment that my hypothetical was silly. I wholeheartedly agree with his comment, the question is silly. But none the less its a question I’ve been asked a lot over 5 years of pitching bitcoin to friends and family. I’ve seen Max Keiser talk about it, I’ve read it in many popular blogs in various ways. The post was nothing special, but still took me 20 mins or so to put together and comment on the first comments I received.\n\nI have replied to the person who flagged me and politely asked what I’ve done wrong and how to avoid it. . . Although before I understood he was actually angry, I made an earlier reply where I laughed along with the flagger’s comment about my silly title. Potentially pissing him off further incidentally. Also, at first I used an image of a book and lantern from Pinterest, but thinking that might have been the issue, switched it to an image from pixabay which I know is public domain. Honestly not sure if I did something against the rules, bad etiquette, that the person didn’t like my title, or they read it fully and just didn’t like my post altogether.\n\nAny help on how to proceed is greatly appreciated! :)\n\n\n1) Should I further attempt to contact the person who flagged me and/or delete my potentially misconstrued comment? I’ve been able to see that they have moved on to other posts and didn’t reply to me.\n\n2) Is it possible to spend money in some way to make my post visible again? I spent $100 worth of SBD on promotion that seemed to have no effect on views at all. Spent another $50 promoting this one in the hopes that some people with knowledge/influence can give me some tips.\n\n3) Would It make sense to maybe alter my post a little and try to repost it? Ultimately this seems to me to be a bad option as I would not be contributing valuable content if I’m just repeating myself. Not sure if this is advisable and could make the influential person even angrier to attack other posts of mine.\n\nAt then end of the day I really really want to use Steem and get into it, but its tough if things I spend time on aren’t visible. I can’t even share the flagged post on my other social media sites like I usually would. Im no scammer or spammer. I’ve been writing about cryptos for years on social media and would like to contribute thoughtful content. I'm passionate about cryptos and Steem!\n\nThanks so much for any help or suggestions! :) :) :)\n\nMy hidden post is here: https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@remistevens/what-happens-to-bitcoin-if-the-internet-is-shut-down\n\n\n![animal-1239131_1920.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUGdd2BdFnsuyQrdL1Yp74PYAHvh8Ud5V153b1x5D6VAD/animal-1239131_1920.jpg)","created":"June 29, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Please help a newbie, I’m not sure why my post was flagged or what to do.","permlink":"please-help-a-newbie-i-m-not-sure-why-my-post-was-flagged-or-what-to-do","previous":{"title":"Morning coffee with Bitcoin, STEEM, and porn, brought to you by DASH X11 mining contracts","permlink":"morning-coffee-with-bitcoin-steem-and-porn-brought-to-you-by-dash-x11-mining-contracts"},"next":{"title":"Single Apple But Two Ideas - The Power of Sharing","permlink":"single-apple-but-two-ideas-the-power-of-sharing"}}}}
