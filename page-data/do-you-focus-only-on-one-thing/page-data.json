It will give you better results, like if you are writing about travel, you should write only that which will make people read and connect with you more.\n\nBut for me it does not mean actually make sense. You should focus on one thing that is true but that does not mean you should ignore other things altogether. Taking the above example itself if you are writing about travel, that does not mean you cannot write about a natural calamity which was happened. Or if you are learning javascript which does not mean that you cannot learn SQL, even though you are focussing only on frontend technology. \n\nFocus does not mean that you cannot check out other things or you cannot work on other things. I am a .Net Developer but still i work on Node.js sometimes does not mean i am changing the focus from .Net but something is better in Node.js.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n\n","created":"November 09, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Do you focus only on one thing?","permlink":"do-you-focus-only-on-one-thing","previous":{"title":"When you can't see what's below you","permlink":"when-you-can-t-see-what-s-below-you"},"next":{"title":"Soothing to Eye - Flower","permlink":"soothing-to-eye-flower"}}}}
