We believe the ecosystem of the whole platform will not be developed sustainably unless developers productivity could be promoted. Asch is also an open platform whose focus is not limited to a particular area, such as finance, document storage, or copywrite proof, but is on providing a series of underlying and abstract APIs, which can be combined and utilized to realize almost all kinds of applications. In addition Asch system utilized enhenced DPOS agorithm in its consensus mechanism to significantly reduce the probability of block fork and the risk of duplicate payment. Most importantly, Asch's sidechain-is-application mode can not only alleviate the blockchain inflation issue, but also make DApp more'\n\n* @virtualgrowth is doing a weekly market update and token give away; Check out his post and vote on your favorite asset [HERE](https://steemit.com/bitshares/@virtualgrowth/steem-bts-and-asset-market-update-7-12-and-giveaway-for-7-19)\n\n* This weeks Bitshares hangout recording has been published and is available [HERE](https://steemit.com/beyondbitcoin/@africa/bitshares-hangout-2017-07-07-beyond-bitcoin-radioshow-raw-recording-for-impatients)\n\n* Current registered wallets/accounts within the Bitshares network is 369317; an increase of 8011 wallets/accounts since last week\n\n* The last asset registered this week is asset #1498 and it is named 'AVERS' registered by 'aversis' with the description 'Settlement unit for Aversis software' googling leads me to [aversis.net/](https://aversis.net/) this seems like a good fit but may not be the actual projects website. \n\n\n#### Smartcoin issueance chart showing weekly change since the start of 2017\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qcPLnE2.png)\n\n#### Openledger team\n![](http://i.imgur.com/RtzmwFR.png)\n\n#### Bitshares telegram user Jonas has received some Bitshares Swag ('BTS HODLER' Shirt, Hat and phone cover)\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Q05HiWO.png)\n\n#### Worker Proposal presented by the Bitshares Blockchain Foundation.
