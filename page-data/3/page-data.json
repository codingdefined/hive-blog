Now we all want to be productive in these times because this time will never come back. Along with productivity, we should start doing what we have dreamt of doing. This is a perfect time because we have ample time in our hands and many of us are getting bored, so why not utilize this time to become better version of yourself.\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/LWekv0HH-image.png)\nPC : Pexels.com\n\nWe should not waste too much time watching the news or surfing social media. I have downloaded some of the Movies, but I have a strict rule to not watch more than 1 movie in 3 days. I also have to spend a considerable amount of time with my kid as she is small. But along with that, I make sure I read or watch videos 1 hour daily. I know we will not get this much time in the future, then why waste. There are things which you can do in this lockdown period.\n\n1. Explore Yourself - I guess this is the perfect time to introspect about you, your character, your behavior as well as your career. Think about what you like about yourself and what you want to improve, and you should work on that to make a better version of yourself after this lockdown.\n\n 2. Get into a reading habit - You might have some books lying in your bookshelf which you always wanted to read but because of time constraint you cannot read, why not get that book out of the shelf and start reading. If you do not have a physical copy of the book, start reading online as there are tons of books available freely.\n\n3. Build a new physique - Yes I am serious, you do not have to go to the gym for good health or physique, you can start today and you can feel the difference in like 10 days that your body is feeling healthy and energetic.\n\n4. Skill Up - Now this is very important if you are a student, a professional or anyone wanted to learn something. This is the time, which will not back again. \n\nTo Skill Up, Pluralsight is giving one-month free access to their courses which says Stay home and Skill Up.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNZGUGNv8ZEJ6XvDbkLD7dREEwaAeqrV9pJZEddsMKti9/image.png)\nPC : https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month\n\nIf you love photography, then why not start with Nikon online courses, which is offering free photography courses all through the month of April (https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/).","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"ocd\",\"india\",\"gems\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"hive\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/LWekv0HH-image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmNZGUGNv8ZEJ6XvDbkLD7dREEwaAeqrV9pJZEddsMKti9\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.pluralsight.com\\/offer\\/2020\\/free-april-month\",\"https:\\/\\/www.nikonevents.com\\/us\\/live\\/nikon-school-online\\/\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b6560712-a6de-5913-958e-abfa513a9373","title":"What Color Attracts?","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 16, 2020","permlink":"what-color-attracts","body":"I wanted to buy toys for my 1.5-year daughter who is a naughty kid, so I just wanted to spend some money on toys to keep her busy. Now the problem is even if she has 10-15 toys like car, doll, soft toys still she plays with 2-3 only. I was curious to know what is exactly the reason for it. One of the things which I noticed that among those 2-3 toys, one thing is common i.e. bright colors.\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/MC4nw158-image.png)\nPC: https://www.pexels.com\n\nI searched Google and found out that the primary colors red, yellow and blue attract babies more than secondary colors like green, orange, and purple. This is because the bright colors reflects nature and they think that the colors which are brighter are more attractive.\n\nThe primary colors and their effect on babies are:\n\nRED: It always attracts attention. \nBLUE: The symbol of cool and calm.\nYELLOW: Represents fun, happiness, and sunshine.\n\nIt seems like my daughter might have overexposed to Red color because she wants attention a whole time. Though it's normal for kids to seek attention, I do not blame her for it. I am thinking of getting toys of blue color to calm her down.\n\nNow, this is mainly what color babies attract, but while searching on Google I found that people want to know all the things the color can attract. \n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/CnFPnwLt-image.png)\n\nThough all the results are common, I don't know why people searched for 'What colors attract money'. Your hard work, your passion, your dedication will surely attract money but does color attract money?\n\nNow when I searched for the exact keyword, I found out that this is actually linked to Astrology. If you wear certain color or paint your home with that color, does not mean that you will get money from nowhere. It actually means that each color has its own distinct energy and based on the energy of these colors, it is possible to attract several things, like them love, money, health etc.\n\nA question to you, do you believe Color attracts money?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"hive-148441\",\"oc\",\"india\",\"gems\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"hive\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/MC4nw158-image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/CnFPnwLt-image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.pexels.com\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"117f2c11-4f59-576e-9b30-e51a2f719ad7","title":"Quarantine Days : Flower Photography - MyPictureDay Submission","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 14, 2020","permlink":"quarantine-days-flower-photography-mypictureday-submission","body":"This is the entry to \"MyPictureDay Photography Contest\" run by @timsaid and sponsored by @blocktrades and @theycallmedan.\n\nUsually, I go out once a month once to click photos of nature. Because of the strict lockdown in India from the last 21 days, I am not able to go outside. The lockdown has been extended for 19 days, so I went to my house terrace to click some photos. Though I could not find any good object to click, I found this wildflower. There are almost 100 of these flowers on the tree, I grabbed one to take Macro photography of it.

My investment from 10% positive has gone down at 25% negative in just about a month. It seems like the Virus is gonna stay a little longer unless Medical science develops a vaccine, we all humans develop an immunity against it or it just disappears somehow. The last two are just hypothetical, the first one is very much possible because we have advanced medical science all over the world and scientists are giving their blood and sweat to find a cure for this deadly virus.\n\nNow given the time, it will take to create a vaccine that might be close to 12-18 months people thinking of withdrawing their retirement investment to avoid further losses which are actually rational thinking. \n\nBut being an investor you should know that ups and downs are part and parcel of the market. This phase is not permanent and after every dark night, we see a ray of new sunshine. \n\nWe should remind ourselves about the 2008 crisis where we have seen much more bloodbath on the market when it went below 50%. And whoever has withdrawn their investment have not recovered their losses because after a year or half market was again back towards its upward journey. You might be thinking like an investor that this time it would be different, but my friend redeeming or exiting from your portfolio causes the actual loss whereas staying invested will give you the time to recover from your loss or even giving profit to you. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZzfxQ75ivWoVbqNYds9te3tA7tTkiYWuYEJwPkPNLS8z/image.png)</center>\n\nHow I am staying invested even after a 30% loss.\n\n1. I have not exited from the market.\n2. I have not cancelled any of my SIPs.\n3. I am investing more (a small amount) after every dip to average out my investment.\n4. Hopeful that tomorrow will be a better day for the markets.\n5. For liquidity, I have around 3 months of my paycheck money in my savings account.\n6. 30% of my total investment is in a debt fund, which is increasing day by day so I do not have to withdraw my equity investment if I need money.\n\nHow you are staying invested, what's your strategy?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemleo\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"investment\",\"motivation\",\"oc\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmSnJr9oSnRa7GhGjkWEj4Fe9JgbNpXbtMGj9v37Ygrqo8\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmZzfxQ75ivWoVbqNYds9te3tA7tTkiYWuYEJwPkPNLS8z\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f54e9b52-7dd7-5b11-8e35-3ba13ce71585","title":"Importance of Saying \"No\"","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 10, 2020","permlink":"importance-of-saying-no","body":"We, humans, have a feeling that saying \"No\" will put us in an awkward situation. We always want to please another person even though we regret it later. But we usually forget that it's so important to tell \"No\" for your own benefit which will make you more honest and authentic in front of others.\n\n>“Let today mark a new beginning for you. Give yourself permission to say NO without feeling guilty, mean, or selfish. Anybody who gets upset and/or expects you to say YES all of the time clearly doesn’t have your best interest at heart. Always remember: You have a right to say NO without having to explain yourself. Be at peace with your decisions.”? Stephanie Lahart\n\nLet's take some example where we usually don't say \"No\",\n\n1. The customer who will not buy your product, but will not say no and end up being followed multiple times by the seller.\n2. HR knows that the candidate is rejected but they keep you hanging without telling you the outcome of the interview.\n3. An employee takes the extra burden on him because he cannot say no and this does drop him in that situation where he cannot do it. \n\n<center>![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmPFVUxGyLZc4rWst3NvaWhfX8CDqwhXhv1FZVKAV36ZTa/image.png)</center>\n\nWhy do we do this, because we are educated like this to be nice to everyone? One of the arguments can be made that what if I don't have an answer at that very moment, then you can take your time but you should keep the person waiting for long just like how HR does with the candidate. What if I wanted to buy but I cannot afford it, then say it that I can't afford instead of just postponing it.\n\nIt not only saves your time but it will build your relationship with others because they know that you are honest and authentic and you do what you really can do.

Almost all the business around the world got a hit in this crisis, but very few businesses still running smoothly like FMCG, Medical Supplies as well as telecom. I think among all that telecom is what people need especially the internet. \n\nIf I talk about myself, I am working from home where I need good internet for connecting to my office VPN. I have ACT broadband which is of 40 Mbps and that is sufficient for me because most of the time I don't connect to VPN. Though ACT Broadband is really good even in 40 Mbps, I didn't find any glitches what's ever.\n\nSo if I talk about ACT business, I really like the gesture they have sent to all the customers in these difficult times. I have got an email today as below :\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVq22HzdEtxEvRKyYPertekyntWp2XTXsqynjFen7oWBE/image.png)\n\nThis means I don't have to pay any extra for the whole month of April to enjoy Unlimited 300 Mbps speed. They have correctly said that \"We always strive to beat the expectations of our customers\". That's right because most of the businesses might be thinking of enhancing their profits, but ACT has done a wonderful job to enhance the customer relationship.\n\nAfter upgrading I am getting the below message in my ACT app, thus now I can enjoy higher speed for the whole month.\n\n![Screenshot_20200409-154400.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmeWocZGfyjW3SCSGvtBgt1sjYPbY8dUJp9J1Xuqpc1o5b/Screenshot_20200409-154400.png)\n\nACT has introduced these benefits to support the work from home culture and encourage people to stay at home.

Many a time we hear people say that I eat healthy foods like fruits, soups or salads, even though I am gaining weight. While it's true that these are healthy foods and its good for health for everyone which provides us with nutrients. But in these difficult times, first of all you will not get these healthy foods often, even though you get it, it's not safe to assume that they are healthy because most of these foods come from cold storage.\n\n![](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1092730/pexels-photo-1092730.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940)\nPC : https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-sliced-fruits-in-white-ceramic-bowl-1092730/\n\nSo what I am trying to say here is that instead of focusing on Eat Healthy in these uncertain times, you need to adjust your eating habits to Eat Right. Eat the right means to adjust your nutrients as per the goal. A good diet should contain a variety of foods which include protein, fruits, veggies, grains, dairy, dry fruits, etc. What I meant to say here is that you need to eat everything but try to keep your calorie in check. Keeping Healthy means you eat healthy foods, but keeping your weight in check means you need to eat as per the energy balance.\n\nSo, for me to remain on the same weight, I need to eat around 2000 Calories. I make sure that I do have a glass of milk in the morning along with Cornflakes or Museli which has around 300 Calories.
