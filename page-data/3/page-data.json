My wife is one of them, she likes Gol Gappa a lot and she goes out every week to have it in the nearby shop. Since the lockdown, its been 1 month and she hasn't tasted it. So being a good and understanding husband, I have got all the ingredients to make the Gol Gappe at home and it turns out to be a good experiment. Though the taste of homemade Puchka was not that great, but still its much more Hydenic than the street one.  We have also learned a lot of things while preparing and will try again in a week's time.\n\nThe Gol Gappe has several names like Pani Puri, Phuchka, Paani ke Patashe, Pakodi, Paani Batashe, Gup Chup, Phulki, Tikki, etc but all tastes the same.\n\nBy the way, Gol Gappe does not have an English name but I can summarize it as Crisp spherical pockets of wheat flour filled with chickpeas, boiled potato, and Indian condiments. It is usually eaten with spiced tamarind water.\n\n![IMG-20200422-WA0000-01.jpeg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmT6yw4ychpoicRyZ4DPDuEfgxsxng9dGvRMwjdWihaak3/IMG-20200422-WA0000-01.jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG-20200422-WA0002-01.jpeg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVgyqvqHvLZMQs1FQVbMRFTESzTpB3ebsNnTKLQMXQjFq/IMG-20200422-WA0002-01.jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG-20200422-WA0003-01.jpeg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWg8KUt8oTG9wfhK1eiTseSbpUDy3arTvM8Nt7rq7Xx9K/IMG-20200422-WA0003-01.jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG-20200422-WA0004-01.jpeg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQSLQVvwkTrNdy97X2Jf6eLqxDyZKBNo4srbM7tyEeumc/IMG-20200422-WA0004-01.jpeg)\n\nThe recipe which we have referred is, though we have given our own touch based on the available ingredients in the lockdown.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw2LYzQNO8o","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"hive-148441\",\"india\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"creativity\",\"ocd\",\"foodphotography\",\"photography\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmT6yw4ychpoicRyZ4DPDuEfgxsxng9dGvRMwjdWihaak3\\/IMG-20200422-WA0000-01.jpeg\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmVgyqvqHvLZMQs1FQVbMRFTESzTpB3ebsNnTKLQMXQjFq\\/IMG-20200422-WA0002-01.jpeg\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmWg8KUt8oTG9wfhK1eiTseSbpUDy3arTvM8Nt7rq7Xx9K\\/IMG-20200422-WA0003-01.jpeg\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmQSLQVvwkTrNdy97X2Jf6eLqxDyZKBNo4srbM7tyEeumc\\/IMG-20200422-WA0004-01.jpeg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/iw2LYzQNO8o\\/0.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=iw2LYzQNO8o\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f428e424-1dc0-5646-930a-948e0b463884","title":"AskHive : Securing Money during Corona Pandemic","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 21, 2020","permlink":"askhive-securing-money-during-corona-pandemic","body":"Corona Virus Pandemic has impacted the business all over the world, like IT, Restaurants, Travel, Banks, etc. The impact will worsen more and more if the virus cannot be controlled.

You all might have eaten idly if you would have been India especially south India where it's very common breakfast. Now you might have eaten the idly in the simple form or in the Rava form were the batter is provided with all the ingredients.

Now we all want to be productive in these times because this time will never come back. Along with productivity, we should start doing what we have dreamt of doing. This is a perfect time because we have ample time in our hands and many of us are getting bored, so why not utilize this time to become better version of yourself.\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/LWekv0HH-image.png)\nPC : Pexels.com\n\nWe should not waste too much time watching the news or surfing social media. I have downloaded some of the Movies, but I have a strict rule to not watch more than 1 movie in 3 days. I also have to spend a considerable amount of time with my kid as she is small. But along with that, I make sure I read or watch videos 1 hour daily. I know we will not get this much time in the future, then why waste. There are things which you can do in this lockdown period.\n\n1. Explore Yourself - I guess this is the perfect time to introspect about you, your character, your behavior as well as your career. Think about what you like about yourself and what you want to improve, and you should work on that to make a better version of yourself after this lockdown.\n\n 2. Get into a reading habit - You might have some books lying in your bookshelf which you always wanted to read but because of time constraint you cannot read, why not get that book out of the shelf and start reading. If you do not have a physical copy of the book, start reading online as there are tons of books available freely.\n\n3. Build a new physique - Yes I am serious, you do not have to go to the gym for good health or physique, you can start today and you can feel the difference in like 10 days that your body is feeling healthy and energetic.\n\n4. Skill Up - Now this is very important if you are a student, a professional or anyone wanted to learn something. This is the time, which will not back again. \n\nTo Skill Up, Pluralsight is giving one-month free access to their courses which says Stay home and Skill Up.\n\n![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNZGUGNv8ZEJ6XvDbkLD7dREEwaAeqrV9pJZEddsMKti9/image.png)\nPC : https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month\n\nIf you love photography, then why not start with Nikon online courses, which is offering free photography courses all through the month of April (https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/).","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"ocd\",\"india\",\"gems\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"hive\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/LWekv0HH-image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/images.hive.blog\\/DQmNZGUGNv8ZEJ6XvDbkLD7dREEwaAeqrV9pJZEddsMKti9\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.pluralsight.com\\/offer\\/2020\\/free-april-month\",\"https:\\/\\/www.nikonevents.com\\/us\\/live\\/nikon-school-online\\/\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"1afe81b1-5d26-504c-a1fe-86e58018ed3c","title":"What Color Attracts?","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 16, 2020","permlink":"what-color-attracts","body":"I wanted to buy toys for my 1.5-year daughter who is a naughty kid, so I just wanted to spend some money on toys to keep her busy. Now the problem is even if she has 10-15 toys like car, doll, soft toys still she plays with 2-3 only. I was curious to know what is exactly the reason for it. One of the things which I noticed that among those 2-3 toys, one thing is common i.e. bright colors.\n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/MC4nw158-image.png)\nPC: https://www.pexels.com\n\nI searched Google and found out that the primary colors red, yellow and blue attract babies more than secondary colors like green, orange, and purple. This is because the bright colors reflects nature and they think that the colors which are brighter are more attractive.\n\nThe primary colors and their effect on babies are:\n\nRED: It always attracts attention. \nBLUE: The symbol of cool and calm.\nYELLOW: Represents fun, happiness, and sunshine.\n\nIt seems like my daughter might have overexposed to Red color because she wants attention a whole time. Though it's normal for kids to seek attention, I do not blame her for it. I am thinking of getting toys of blue color to calm her down.\n\nNow, this is mainly what color babies attract, but while searching on Google I found that people want to know all the things the color can attract. \n\n![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/CnFPnwLt-image.png)\n\nThough all the results are common, I don't know why people searched for 'What colors attract money'. Your hard work, your passion, your dedication will surely attract money but does color attract money?\n\nNow when I searched for the exact keyword, I found out that this is actually linked to Astrology. If you wear certain color or paint your home with that color, does not mean that you will get money from nowhere. It actually means that each color has its own distinct energy and based on the energy of these colors, it is possible to attract several things, like them love, money, health etc.\n\nA question to you, do you believe Color attracts money?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"hive-148441\",\"oc\",\"india\",\"gems\",\"palnet\",\"neoxian\",\"hive\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/MC4nw158-image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/files.peakd.com\\/file\\/peakd-hive\\/codingdefined\\/CnFPnwLt-image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.pexels.com\"],\"app\":\"hiveblog\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"53f8128e-c76d-5ac3-9e48-9bd55a54b98b","title":"Quarantine Days : Flower Photography - MyPictureDay Submission","author":"codingdefined","created":"April 14, 2020","permlink":"quarantine-days-flower-photography-mypictureday-submission","body":"This is the entry to \"MyPictureDay Photography Contest\" run by @timsaid and sponsored by @blocktrades and @theycallmedan.\n\nUsually, I go out once a month once to click photos of nature.
