To take a good photo you do not need a DSLR or something, a normal camera can take great image as well. You need to keep in mind few things when taking images. In that one important factor is the focus. Focussing on the right object can make a image from good to great. Let me show you an example.\n\nThe below image is the first image where the focus is kept on the sky. When the focus is on the sky, the trees are hardly visible and all are almost black in colour.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus1.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYvaEVtJcv6juv1ujmfGAhMzuhDcDSFEfeNUuXdfauQ3e/IMG_20171011_173504.jpg)\n\nThe below image is the second image where the focus is kept on the trees. When the focus is on the trees, the sky just glooms out in which you can hardly see the sun.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQJ5A9krHJu2pYCUiMsF7uPHvfrLYCoU4u3V6JP7Hpanr/IMG_20171011_173525.jpg)\n\nThis is the picture perfect where the focus is one the edge of the sky and the trees, thus you can see clearly the sun as well as teh trees. And since it was raining on that day, you can also see the water droplets.\n\n![steemit_sunset_focus3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmepxLsmP3unuLYiMPDBFXP8RpusRKbpY8TQi2QCVkDKkT/IMG_20171011_173457.jpg)\n\nNow when you have the image you can do some editing, like colour enhancement, contrast, brightness to make this image a little more soothing. In my next post I will show how to edit the image from your Smartphone itself. So after the editing the above image will look like below :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYoASWcFbZKKPQdv8FiYC92qb1bEUN9BTG223KvBhmkcy/image.png)\n\nThe above image is also shared [here](https://steemit.com/colorchallenge/@codingdefined/colorchallenge-thursday-green-trees-in-rain-20171012t12010563z)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>All the images are taken from Nokia 6 Camera</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>\n\n<hr>","created":"October 14, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How Changing Focus can help you to get a Great Image","permlink":"how-changing-focus-can-help-you-to-get-a-great-image","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - Blue Sky","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue-blue-sky-20171013t161915153z"},"next":{"title":"Spring or Autumn?
