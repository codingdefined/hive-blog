So let's discuss both the aspects of it.\n\nLet's Say there are two freinds let them call A and B both earn $100 in a month. One save $50 and other did not save anything but he creates memories by enjoying his life from that $100. A being a conservative one does not go out to eat much, does not travel often and saves as much as possible whereas B is totally opposite of it.\n\nSo the question is should you become A or B. Both are good in their spending patters, one spend for future and other for his memories. Now since we all might have heard once that Life is Short, I.e. enjoy as much as possible, so if we think that way then B is good. Bit what if you live for 70 years and you dont want to work after 50 and just relax after 50 then the path taken by A is good.\n\nAs far as I know, you should live in your present and keep an eye on the future. That's what i do most of the time, I try to save as much as possible but not at the expense of today. What I meant to say I do save money for the future but not to retire early but just to play safe, though I enjoy my life too either by travelling or doing what I like. Since you cannot predict future you need to be prepared on both fronts, and that's what I try to do.\n\nLet's hear from you, what you think?","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"discussion\",\"india\",\"writing\",\"blog\",\"esteem\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"36a02d12-7fdc-5168-b896-5763b8082db1","title":"Cat Fish in Lake","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 24, 2018","permlink":"cat-fish-in-lake-4d206947e9435","body":"We see a lot of fish in Aquarium either in a park, in friend's place or even in some restuarants, though we usually do not feed them.

Being a newbie in React, I asked @knowledges if I can work on some task and then after getting a go-ahead to implement Search functionality I started working on it.\n\nThe endpoint of searching against User and Post a.k.a. Articles were present, we just have to connect them to the frontend. I started with creating a function which will take a search term and give us data from the API for both User and Posts. \n\nRelevant Commit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/41/commits/75dc176bb8ee69743ef78048e436ff6e5c0188f9\n\nNext was to create a new route for search, '/search?q='. So whenever a user clicks on a search button, the user will be taken to that page itself where searched posts and users will be shown. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWA8fk8TA1fNTzbDVXUZmFUZ9tdet4nhBN8MdQL8JtWM3/image.png)\n\nWe also have to take care two things out here, which are written in the if condition.\n\n1. We will not search if the search term is less than 2, because then the search will be meaningless.\n2. If the user has searched and if he clicks again, we should not initiate the search again.\n\nRelevant Commit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/41/commits/b83c90d96cb53dce10fd4a911810a5d0deaee7e4\n \nNext was to show the Search Posts and User.
