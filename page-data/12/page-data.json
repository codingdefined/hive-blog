Being a newbie in React, I asked @knowledges if I can work on some task and then after getting a go-ahead to implement Search functionality I started working on it.\n\nThe endpoint of searching against User and Post a.k.a. Articles were present, we just have to connect them to the frontend. I started with creating a function which will take a search term and give us data from the API for both User and Posts. \n\nRelevant Commit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/41/commits/75dc176bb8ee69743ef78048e436ff6e5c0188f9\n\nNext was to create a new route for search, '/search?q='. So whenever a user clicks on a search button, the user will be taken to that page itself where searched posts and users will be shown. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmWA8fk8TA1fNTzbDVXUZmFUZ9tdet4nhBN8MdQL8JtWM3/image.png)\n\nWe also have to take care two things out here, which are written in the if condition.\n\n1. We will not search if the search term is less than 2, because then the search will be meaningless.\n2. If the user has searched and if he clicks again, we should not initiate the search again.\n\nRelevant Commit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/41/commits/b83c90d96cb53dce10fd4a911810a5d0deaee7e4\n \nNext was to show the Search Posts and User. Since I do not want to reinvent the wheel, I just use the existing component to show the Post, though for user I have to write a couple of lines. \n\nRelevant Commit : https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem.org/pull/41/commits/76e1b04a907963ec619e6587205b588b79c1558e\n\n#### Lessons Learnt\n\nA lot of lessons has been learned for creating this functionality, like how to send the data from one component to other, how to use Redux etc. I guess it will be a good leaning curve to continue working on this.\n\n#### GitHub Account\n\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"development\",\"technology\",\"knacksteem\",\"programming\"],\"users\":[\"knowledges\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmWA8fk8TA1fNTzbDVXUZmFUZ9tdet4nhBN8MdQL8JtWM3\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/41\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/41\\/commits\\/75dc176bb8ee69743ef78048e436ff6e5c0188f9\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/41\\/commits\\/b83c90d96cb53dce10fd4a911810a5d0deaee7e4\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/knacksteem\\/knacksteem.org\\/pull\\/41\\/commits\\/76e1b04a907963ec619e6587205b588b79c1558e\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"2d0d22b0-387c-54f5-bb56-7e10bd328913","title":"Beautiful Looking flowers","author":"codingdefined","created":"November 13, 2018","permlink":"beautiful-looking-flowers-1028587994e9a","body":"While going for my evening walk, I saw some beautiful looking white flowers.

Faith is the belief you keep on yourself to become your own role model. People all over the world use symbols or representative for worship, be it river, structure, book, idols or even charms. These are the center's of faith which benefit the believers by fulfilling their desires.\n\nNow the question is, how come some people prayers are answered whereas others it's not. This is where the faith come into picture. This is just like a physical science where faith gives you desired result by the power of your soul. In Hindi it's called Atma-Shakti or inner power. The science I am talking about is the Newton third law where every action has its equal reaction, just like if you throw a ball against a wall it will rebound with equal force.\n\nWhen you pray with your full power, your faith along with the force of soul strikes with the force to your believed object and rebound back as a desired results. Now we must understand that to fulfill that results not only your faith but your action should also go hand in hand. There is a saying in India that God help those people who wants to help themselves. If you have the faith, but do not have a inner strength to the work then you will not get the desired results.\n\n> A Quote : The reason birds can fly and we can't is simple because they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings.
