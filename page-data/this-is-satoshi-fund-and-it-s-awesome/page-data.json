You literally just need to send Bitcoin, and 24 hours later you will receive SPIES Shares based on Coinmarketcap NAV ([Net Asset Value](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp))\n\n# Dashboard\n\nIt's clean, and shows every data possible.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdngFBF5PJwVqAT8FZScrVF1j2K3gnSBgWm7peJFW57Qy/2017-07-05%2016_10_58-Satoshi%20Pie.png)\n\n# Exit\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeGD41h88yZ7zKy4K5Xd8qQAdduLfBPW2JUsikx8HyUt1/2017-07-05%2016_11_59-Satoshi%20Pie.png)\n\nJust select `Redeem` and enter your Bitcoin address, you'll receive Bitcoin based on NAV (same as Investing).\n\nYou're free to move SPIES to your regular BitShares account, and you can trade them on their DEX Market, obviously.\n\n# Fees\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmd8QcW7TJtehvq76vDrUcdA5wKMqyXH4rCAMwxJZaQxgv/2017-07-05%2016_13_48-Satoshi%20Pie.png)\n\nThe slice of the pie comes at a price.\n\nEntrance Fee: 5%\nExit Fee: 5%\n\nso investing goal should be long term.\n\nThis may sound expensive, but it's still much cheaper than conventional Managed Funds *or Prism*.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is the prime example for a specific and tailored product on BitShares DEX. It's very consumer friendly, and requires very limited knowledge of BitShares. \nNew users won't even notice the Blockchain!\n\n----------\n[![](http://i.imgur.com/1mUxxrl.png)](https://rebrand.ly/steem)\n[Buy and Sell Steem & Steem Dollar at **best rates!**](https://rebrand.ly/steem)\n\nBlog: [FAVS dot PW](http://favs.pw)\nContact: [btsfav @ twitter](https://twitter.com/btsfav)\nSteem: [ash @ steem](https://steemit.com/@ash?r=ash) ─ [Steemit How-To's](http://smarturl.it/howtosteem)","created":"July 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"This is Satoshi.Fund and it's awesome.","permlink":"this-is-satoshi-fund-and-it-s-awesome","previous":{"title":"Quick SteemFest² Update: Visiting Lisbon & Sponsorships","permlink":"quick-steemfest-update-visiting-lisbon-and-sponsorships"},"next":{"title":"SHOCKING!
