Its great that Utopian is growing so fast that when you call for task assignment anyone who is not working on anything can grab that task and start working.\n\nIn one of the line of @deveerei post he said that \n\n>I only know basic CSS and HTML which gives me the trouble of finding the proper places in the Github Repository to edit to show those changes on the colors in the game.\n\nSo my tutorial is for @deveerei as well as everyone who wants to know how to find details if you want to change anything.\n\n@deveerie was kind enough to provide us the [test site](https://deveerei.github.io/OhSteem/), so just head over that site, you can see a very nice colourful website.\n\nThe task which he has asked is to change Red and Blue into Teal and Midnight Blue. So lets find out what are the classes in CSS we need to change. When you are in the page just hit F12 or right click and do Inspect Element you will see a window like below.\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510923027/fe2njmu0tpo2dankzndg.png)\n\nNext is to find out the exact element. For that go to the left hand corner where you will see something like below\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510923420/bg91qqhyulfxf7xpb62f.png)\n\nClick on that and click on any element on the web page to find out that element. Once you do that you can see all the classes attached to that element, now just go to the right hand side of the Inspect Element window you will see a list of classes and all the details about that.\n\nNow as you can see in the below GIF, I have actually found out the element and then tried to change its colors. Now you have to find out that exact class in your css files and then change it.\n\n![ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1510923343/mlf0w1dlz0lkdaugozx2.gif)\n\nThe CSS files which can be updated is https://github.com/deveerei/OhSteem/blob/master/css/style.css. \n\nI am not going to show you more as there are developers working on it. But just that I wanted to write this for @deveerie so that if there is any urgent work he can actually look into it.\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/how-to-find-css-element\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"November 17, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How to find CSS element","permlink":"how-to-find-css-element","previous":{"title":"Someone Watching us through the Sky","permlink":"someone-watching-us-through-the-sky"},"next":{"title":"Color challenge -  Saturday Indigo - Flower","permlink":"color-challenge-saturday-indigo-flower"}}}}
