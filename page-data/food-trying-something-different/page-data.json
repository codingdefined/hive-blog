So done something creative with the food too today. Creativity is nothing where you start drawing or paint, but creativity also comes out from a Chef where he brings all his creativity to bring the best out of the ingredients to make something worth while.\n\n**Tried Stuffed Idli**\n\nYes you heard it right. You all might have eaten idly if you would have been India especially south India where it's very common breakfast. Now you might have eaten the idly in the simple form or in the Rava form were the batter is provided with all the ingredients. But today we have tried Potato Stuffed Idli just like Aloo Paratha and it turns out to be a great experiment. This a mix and match of North Indian Aloo Paratha and South Indian Idly.\n\n![ezv0ie.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/ezv0ie.jpg)\n\n**Sprouts with Idly**\n\nNow again in the evening tried something which is not too common. Sprouts is healthy and I try to eat it everyday in evening. We had some Idly left in the morning so thought of adding it along with some veggies like Potato, Tomato and Onion. So not only it was a healthy snacks but a chat pata chaat which we were carving since the lockdown.\n\n![pqakg4.jpg](https://img.esteem.app/pqakg4.jpg)\n\nSo have you tried something which is a mix and match and which come to be a great experiment. If not then this is the time to bring out your creativity. Though I know, now we all should try to keep our creativity to that extent where we don't have to waste too much of our food.
