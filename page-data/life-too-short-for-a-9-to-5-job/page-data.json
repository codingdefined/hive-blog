If you live closer to work, you save time on commute. But, the ever increasing work load & agile deadlines can eat away time saved elsewhere.\n\nIf you manage to restrict work to office hours, you do get 2 hours everyday for self. You get paid on time, pay your bills on time and save some money. That’s great. But, wait, there are too many things that can go wrong in this setup.
