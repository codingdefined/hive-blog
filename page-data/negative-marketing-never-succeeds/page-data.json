Whenever I go to buy any product and if the person compares that product with other products and tell me the negative of that product, I will make sure I will never buy a product from that place, because he is not telling me the good things about his product and that's what I want to know. \n\n<center>![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfX7dRkZDkWmnmwGZ4ybqSptARqNfV2iCgxU9jJQ7AwXE/image.png)</center>\nPC : https://www.maxpixel.net/Positive-High-Thumb-Plus-Down-Negative-Opposites-489521\n\nRecently there was a new MotorBike Launch in India i.e. Bajaj Dominor which has a lot of good qualities and have a lot to offer.
