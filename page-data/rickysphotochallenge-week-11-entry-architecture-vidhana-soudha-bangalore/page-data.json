The theme is Architecture for this week. </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n#### <center> Vidhana Soudha is the seat of Karnataka's Legislative assembly which was completed in the year of 1956. I have included more than 1 pic to show the architecture of the picture. Common people are not allowed inside the gate but it is well illuminated on Sunday's and Public Holidays and it is one of the tourist attraction in Bangalore. Might be I will get a shot of fully illuminated Vidhan Soudha some day, till then enjoy the architecture. </center>\n#### <center> Camera Used : Nokia 6 Mobile Camera - 16 MP, No Editing done </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170903_170040.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSDVuKqayCXESrVVKVwCvpWqxQymaogCZejGzXiKnvdKN/IMG_20170903_170040.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20170903_170255.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdj7jU2VtGaoK13o13CQNgcnMoWXAGiabLqpEkBBJzt6Q/IMG_20170903_170255.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> If you liked my work, please do follow @codingdefined </center>","created":"September 19, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Rickysphotochallenge Week 11 Entry - Architecture - Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore","permlink":"rickysphotochallenge-week-11-entry-architecture-vidhana-soudha-bangalore","previous":{"title":"Let us all Start Coding","permlink":"let-us-all-start-coding"},"next":{"title":"Don't Give Up and Don't Give In","permlink":"don-t-give-up-and-don-t-give-in"}}}}
