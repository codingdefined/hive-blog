The air here is of freedom and the sacrifices made by the heroes i.e. real heroes who protected this country. To name few there are Subhas Chandra, Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev. \n\nStill the country is developing but I am happy that we are on a right path with a wave of development which will make every city and every village to be happy. Dreams will come true like the dream of freedom came true on 1947.\n\nLet's make this world better by making yourself better and educating people around you.
