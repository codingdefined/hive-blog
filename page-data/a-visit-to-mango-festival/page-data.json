The best part of this festival was that you can buy different varieties of mango in cheap and also without worrying about the quality as the mangoes are organic and grown naturally. \n<hr>\nNote: The festival was from May 2019 to June 2019. \n<hr>\nIt was also a good knowledge session to know these many varieties of mangos because normally we came across 2-3 varieties of mango only. \n\n### Few facts:\n\n>1. Mango, the \"King of Fruits\" is an important fruit crop popular for its taste and nutritional benefits.\n>2. The fruit has its origin in Indo-Burma region.\n>3. In India about 40 varieties are commercially grown across various states in tropical, Sub-tropical and coastal areas.\n>4. Cultivated in an area of 25.16 lak hectares with production of 184.31 lak tonnes in India.\n\n![IMG_1333.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTLsYZyUNP4ZwhAvq3dtJt8T9ynz3S5hKz7UUsLQamEib)\n\nIn the above image, you can see Lal Muni, Nazuk Badam and Ostin. Since we were not allowed to go closer the photos were not that clear. Few more varieties are :\n\n### Ostin\n\n![IMG_1329.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qma5GJY4YzfVnwVdJ3MAxahCu8QYDTAAs21GYRZW1foMrM)\n\n### Amrapali\n\n![IMG_1330.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWvBokEBRdYVYnqJcr4TsRQk4V6ezrcZuaqeXtL3wVvzS)\n\n### And my favorite : Alphanso\n\n![IMG_1332.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmX65hJBdCu8ZXZLJfciM9kpD87ySucsPq7LSSVPY9RsDD)\n\nThere were a lot of people attending the festival as who will not buy the organic mangoes in cheap price.\n\n![IMG_1337.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmeKEKgUH5fkMYc7XGs4dCVLGzLuADZcwAuVcBHgw6SRnP)\n\n![IMG_1342.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUv5yy1MY7fDaqBofgy7c92bMieD8FUPZcQtAupKApR6L)\n\n![IMG_1341.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZvjX7HbYH7nF1sQwRLFF4TVrSTF2AS96NLkbtPgFzrrc)\n\nOne thing I liked about this festival is that all the sellers were farmers who have come all the way from their native village which is around 200-250 km to sell these mangoes and earn a livelihood. There was no middleman involved which means all the money goes directly to the farmer and they will live happily for the rest of the year and prepare for the next year. \n\nSo if you happen to be in Bangalore in May or June next year, do plan to visit the Mango Festival and buy some tasty mangoes. \n\nBdw I got the box full of Mango this year :\n\n![IMG_1335.jpg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaopawpW6z4EWXJg6GAJLnfVYLP1VfKqTfTgkxr5UbEue)\n","created":"September 10, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Visit to Mango Festival","permlink":"a-visit-to-mango-festival","previous":{"title":"An Awesome Architecture","permlink":"an-awesome-architecture"},"next":{"title":"A Different Perspective - Fish Eye View","permlink":"a-different-perspective-fish-eye-view"}}}}
