In what makes it significantly different from the existing system, GST is a destination-based tax. Currently, the central government levies excise duty on the manufacture, and then the state adds VAT (Value Added tax) when the item is sold to the next stage in the cycle â€” i.e. from processed raw material like rubber to be manufactured into tyres. Then there would be a VAT at the next point of sale - i.e. when the tyre is sold to the dealership and then to the consumer and so on. \n\nUnder the new taxation regime fruits, vegetables, pulses, wheat, bread and rice are exempted from taxation even as chips, biscuits, butter, tea and coffee are attracting higher taxes. This is how the monthly budget of a Common Indian will be affected by GST.\n\nhttp://static.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/19/576644-gstbudget.jpg","created":"June 30, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"GST is India's biggest tax reform","permlink":"gst-is-india-s-biggest-tax-reform","previous":{"title":"Why Gets Your Hand Dirty in Entrepreneurship","permlink":"why-gets-your-hand-dirty-in-entrepreneurship"},"next":{"title":"World's longest Continuously Running Experiment - Pitch drop","permlink":"world-s-longest-continuously-running-experiment-pitch-drop"}}}}
