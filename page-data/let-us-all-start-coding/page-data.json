As you might have searched 100 of times that which programming language to start coding with and end up getting so many results that makes you confused. If you go to [List of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) in Wikipedia you will end up getting 1000 of programming languages into existence. Thus to simplify things for the beginners I have written this post that which programming language you should start with if you are completely new in programming.\n\nHere I will list down some of the programming languages which you can start coding almost instantly. I will not go in deep about what all the different categories of programming languages out there, what is the difference between them bla bla. My sole motto of this article would be to share with you guys that which programming language you can start almost instantly.\n\nList of Programming Languages to start with if you are completely new in programming.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> JavaScript </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**JavaScript** - When I have started my coding journey I have started with JavaScript and that is what I will recommend you all too. JavaScript is a client side scripting language (which runs on users browser) which is used for front-end development (means what you see in front of you in teh browser). The advantage of JavaScript is that it is compatible across all the browsers and it is very easy to learn. Steemit web front is also written in JavaScipt as shown below.\n\n![steemit1.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNunjBnogn9ur9NJXoyc6btCMganypHtRkYuerYt47QVr/steemit1.JPG)\n\nNow have I said that it is used in creating only client side, then Sorry, Javascript can also be used as a server-side language through the Node.js Platform. Now if you know JavaScript you can create a full fledge website like Steemit (showing front end to the users along with HTML, getting the data from the database using Node.js etc).\n\nSince I have shared with you how easy is to start with JavaScript, then you should also keep in mind that sometimes it becomes very difficult to debug this when the program gets bigger and bigger. If you are convinced on starting with JavaScript as your fiest language then there is no better platform then [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) which is a community that helps you learn to code with a very interactive style of teaching. It is 100% free to start with.\n\nI have even created a Ball Bouncing Game (https://codepen.io/codingdefined/pen/YyvLQZ) using HTML5 and JavaScript which shows how easy is to create a game if you know JavaScript. And please don't play the game now, complete the article first :P.\n\n![steemit2.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQrowsK2xp4AyrawgefiQGLyLE5mZCdz27SEgGAV3YT3a/steemit2.JPG)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Ruby </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**Ruby** - Ruby is one of the easiest programming language to learn. It is considered as a High-Level Programming language which means you do not have to write a lot of code to make computer understand what exactly you want your computer to do. The advantage of Ruby is that it reads like English and you can actually write down all the commands by just using English language words. If you want to lean Ruby, you just have to spare 20 minutes of your time. You might be thinking I am kidding, but no check out [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) it will teach you ruby in 20 minutes.\n\nThe best quote about Ruby I liked is \"Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body\"\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Python</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n**Python** - Not the Snake Python but a programming language. Just before getting to know more about Python, I would like to state that it is #1 choice in U.S. as an introdcutory language for a newbies. Again it is a very easy to learn programming language and it definately provides a steeping stone into the world of programming. Main advantage of using Pythin is the simplicity of its code thus allowing the beginners to grasp it very easily.\n\nIf you really want to learn Python then nothing can beat [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-program-using-python-utarlingtonx-cse1309x) which gives free online courses.\n\nNow I usually use JavaScript in all my projects. The advantage or importance of using it is that I do not have to learn any other language if I wanted to build a full web application. So if you want to start your coding journey I would definately recommend these three languages above.\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center> Follow @codingdefined </center>","created":"September 18, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Let us all Start Coding","permlink":"let-us-all-start-coding","previous":{"title":"ðŸ“· Contest - #architecturalphotography - Shree Shyam Mandir, Bangalore, India ðŸ“·","permlink":"contest-architecturalphotography-shree-shyam-mandir-bangalore-india"},"next":{"title":"Rickysphotochallenge Week 11 Entry - Architecture - Vidhana Soudha, Bangalore","permlink":"rickysphotochallenge-week-11-entry-architecture-vidhana-soudha-bangalore"}}}}
