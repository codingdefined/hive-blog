Whenever we say about power we think of only one's body's strength. Whenever we think of powerful people we only think about wrestlers or body builders but we often ignore them who do not have great body but have a great mind who controls via their thoughts.\n\nWhen we think about any person like this, first name comes to mind is Mahatma Gandhi who do not have power in his body but had a will power which made him unstoppable. This is what the strength is all about , the power or strength is not what we see it, but it's all about the will power. We can do a lot of things with our body if our inner powee or will power supports us. \n\nThis is the beauty of will power which helps your body's strength to do the work and if any one takes full control of its will power he can do wonders. That's what we call it awakening of thoughts or having your will power to do the wonders.\n\nIn our next post we will see how we can improve our will power I.e what are the steps which helps us to awaken our thoughts.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"india\",\"health\",\"motivation\",\"writing\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d2e3421c-e96d-570f-a33e-f4135adc4538","title":"You need a Ice Cream","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 25, 2018","permlink":"you-need-a-ice-cream-2b1b36c4c21f3","body":"You need a Ice Cream, which was written on the box in which I ate the ice cream.

One good advantage of using appveyor is that it is free for Open Source repositories. It's actually good when your repo is accepting pull request from people and then you can test if the pull request is merging or not. \n\nOn the other hand, Codec helps you to do a health check on your code, i.e. it is a measurement on how many lines of your code are executed when automated tests are performing. Now 100% Code Coverage means that all your code is covered under tests, but that is very hard to achieve. \n\nI have to do a lot of commits to test the AppVeyor and Codecov and at last, it iwas successful and I can build and generate a code coverage report for my application. At first, I have started using NuGet package OpenCover to create code-coverage in my local environment and it was working after trial and error method.\n\nThe Script I have used is as below\n\n```\nOpenCover.Console.exe -register:user \n-target:\"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\" \n-targetargs:\"test\\LetsDisc.Tests\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.1\\LetsDisc.Tests.dll -noshadow\" \n-oldStyle -output:\".\\coverage.xml\" \n-filter:\"+[LetsDisc*]* -[Tests*]*\" -coverbytest:\"XUnit\"\n```\n----\n\nBut as a developer, we should know that what works in local has a 100% probability that it will not work in some other environments. That is what happened in my case when I tried to run the above script in AppVeyor some or the other issues are popping up. But at last, I made it work. So the final script is\n\n```\nversion: 1.0.{build}\nimage: Visual Studio 2017\nconfiguration: Release\nskip_tags: true\nbefore_build:\n - nuget restore\n - nuget install OpenCover -OutputDirectory packages -Version 4.6.519\nbuild_script:\n - msbuild /verbosity:quiet LetsDisc.sln\ntest_script:\n - .\\packages\\OpenCover.4.6.519\\tools\\OpenCover.Console.exe \n-register:user \n-target:\"C:/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe\" \n-targetargs:\"test --logger:trx;LogFileName=results.trx \n/p:DebugType=full \nC:\\projects\\letsdisc\\test\\LetsDisc.Tests\\LetsDisc.Tests.csproj\" \n-output:\"coverage.xml\" -filter:\"+[LetsDisc*]* -[Tests*]*\"\nafter_test:\n  - ps: |\n      $env:PATH = 'C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin;' + $env:PATH\n      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://codecov.io/bash' -OutFile codecov.sh\n      bash codecov.sh -f \"coverage.xml\"\n```\n----\n\nThe above script means on every build I will be updating it with a version of 1.0.{buildNumber}, then use Visual Studio 2017 as an image to build the project, then use configuration as release mode and not debug so that it can be easily deployable. Before the build just restoring all the nuget package, as well as installing OpenCover specific version which works with AppVeyor. After that building the project using msbuild and then running my test script to run the tests and create the coverage report. After the test is scuccessful deploying the coverage.xml file to the Codecov website.\n\nIt was fun as well as a learning experiment where I learned to use an Appveyor app as well adding the Coverage report to my project. \n\nRepo : https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc\n\n----\n\n#### Also Published to My Personal Blog: https://www.codingdefined.com/2018/10/how-i-added-appveyor-codecov-to-net.html","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"india\",\"developer\",\"programming\",\"opensource\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\\/LetsDisc\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2018\\/10\\/how-i-added-appveyor-codecov-to-net.html\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b4adbf56-a7c3-5778-aba8-dbf63fe3ceec","title":"Beautiful Sunday Trip to BBQ'D Restaurant","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 14, 2018","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-trip-to-bbq-d-restaurant","body":"Today I visited BBQ'D Restaurant with my friends to attend a party.

The goal of this project is to create a solid general-purpose bot that can be easily extended and used in new and interesting ways.\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n###### Issue?\n\nThe help command of the bot was not checking the size of the embed. When the size reaches 6000 characters an exception is thrown and no help is sent as shown below https://github.com/discord-bot-tutorial/Community-Discord-BOT/issues/81\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPzZ6Q7AGN41LZfGshd8bQKwJUHS8sqgmuNiYA21iYWT7/image.png)\n\n###### Solution?\n\nAfter checking the code, all the help messages is adding as an Embed Field and when we are building the message the length of the message is going over 6000. At first I have taken a deep copy of the Embed Fields \n\n`var fields = builder.Fields.ToList();`\n\nNow checking if the embed length is over 6000. If it is more than 6000 removing the initial 10 fields from the embed. After removing fields again checking the length, if it is more just decreasing the initial count by 1 so that this time I will take one less than the previous one. \n\nSo when I am sending the message I am sending it for the first 10 fields only and the next message is sent for the remaining field. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmV1FJbV4NJyrPtCJrTQQvJYJjeGwDkQ91aEipbEcqSbX6/image.png)\n\n#### GitHub Account\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"development\",\"steemdev\",\"india\",\"coding\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmPzZ6Q7AGN41LZfGshd8bQKwJUHS8sqgmuNiYA21iYWT7\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmV1FJbV4NJyrPtCJrTQQvJYJjeGwDkQ91aEipbEcqSbX6\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/discord-bot-tutorial\\/Community-Discord-BOT\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/discord-bot-tutorial\\/Community-Discord-BOT\\/pull\\/130\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/discord-bot-tutorial\\/Community-Discord-BOT\\/issues\\/81\",\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"5dba9f61-0107-5301-bd5d-8f0d5cd23c81","title":"A Glowing Hotel","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 11, 2018","permlink":"a-glowing-hotel","body":"### This image is of Vivanta by Taj in Yesvantpur, Bangalore\n\n![IMG_20181010_191817-01.jpeg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmd22xzH5nkQRezGk9w94V8WykwYTYDtvnJ7hMeKEjBKEL)\n\n### Camera : Nokia 6\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"india\",\"photography\",\"busy\",\"photo\",\"photocircle\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/Qmd22xzH5nkQRezGk9w94V8WykwYTYDtvnJ7hMeKEjBKEL\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"777d71a6-fa07-5441-8642-5201fb7db507","title":"Land War on Earth","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 10, 2018","permlink":"land-war-on-earth","body":"Humans existence on Earth would be more than 20000 years ago, but they have never fought for land as they are doing now.

Hatred is driving the society and that makes people want more and more things under their name be it big bunglow, land or a big car.\n\nIf we talk about financial situation, humans are not in a very good condition either. Everywhere you will see that there is a huge difference between riches and poors and the gap is rising every day. Though most of the people are not poor but since their expectation is mismatch with their financial condition they think themselves as poor i.e. they cannot buy clothes in every occasion, or they cannot travel outstation every month etc.","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"writing\",\"india\",\"life\",\"busy\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmanB7eYoue3xZeRvNLLXsrV8WWymtpURmP5mJoLmyKTwx\\/image.png\"]}"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":10,"skip":120,"numPages":74,"currentPage":13}}}
