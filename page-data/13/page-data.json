Faith is the belief you keep on yourself to become your own role model. People all over the world use symbols or representative for worship, be it river, structure, book, idols or even charms. These are the center's of faith which benefit the believers by fulfilling their desires.\n\nNow the question is, how come some people prayers are answered whereas others it's not. This is where the faith come into picture. This is just like a physical science where faith gives you desired result by the power of your soul. In Hindi it's called Atma-Shakti or inner power. The science I am talking about is the Newton third law where every action has its equal reaction, just like if you throw a ball against a wall it will rebound with equal force.\n\nWhen you pray with your full power, your faith along with the force of soul strikes with the force to your believed object and rebound back as a desired results. Now we must understand that to fulfill that results not only your faith but your action should also go hand in hand. There is a saying in India that God help those people who wants to help themselves. If you have the faith, but do not have a inner strength to the work then you will not get the desired results.\n\n> A Quote : The reason birds can fly and we can't is simple because they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings.

Whenever we say about power we think of only one's body's strength. Whenever we think of powerful people we only think about wrestlers or body builders but we often ignore them who do not have great body but have a great mind who controls via their thoughts.\n\nWhen we think about any person like this, first name comes to mind is Mahatma Gandhi who do not have power in his body but had a will power which made him unstoppable. This is what the strength is all about , the power or strength is not what we see it, but it's all about the will power. We can do a lot of things with our body if our inner powee or will power supports us. \n\nThis is the beauty of will power which helps your body's strength to do the work and if any one takes full control of its will power he can do wonders. That's what we call it awakening of thoughts or having your will power to do the wonders.\n\nIn our next post we will see how we can improve our will power I.e what are the steps which helps us to awaken our thoughts.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"india\",\"health\",\"motivation\",\"writing\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"d2e3421c-e96d-570f-a33e-f4135adc4538","title":"You need a Ice Cream","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 25, 2018","permlink":"you-need-a-ice-cream-2b1b36c4c21f3","body":"You need a Ice Cream, which was written on the box in which I ate the ice cream.

One good advantage of using appveyor is that it is free for Open Source repositories. It's actually good when your repo is accepting pull request from people and then you can test if the pull request is merging or not. \n\nOn the other hand, Codec helps you to do a health check on your code, i.e. it is a measurement on how many lines of your code are executed when automated tests are performing. Now 100% Code Coverage means that all your code is covered under tests, but that is very hard to achieve. \n\nI have to do a lot of commits to test the AppVeyor and Codecov and at last, it iwas successful and I can build and generate a code coverage report for my application. At first, I have started using NuGet package OpenCover to create code-coverage in my local environment and it was working after trial and error method.\n\nThe Script I have used is as below\n\n```\nOpenCover.Console.exe -register:user \n-target:\"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\" \n-targetargs:\"test\\LetsDisc.Tests\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.1\\LetsDisc.Tests.dll -noshadow\" \n-oldStyle -output:\".\\coverage.xml\" \n-filter:\"+[LetsDisc*]* -[Tests*]*\" -coverbytest:\"XUnit\"\n```\n----\n\nBut as a developer, we should know that what works in local has a 100% probability that it will not work in some other environments. That is what happened in my case when I tried to run the above script in AppVeyor some or the other issues are popping up. But at last, I made it work. So the final script is\n\n```\nversion: 1.0.{build}\nimage: Visual Studio 2017\nconfiguration: Release\nskip_tags: true\nbefore_build:\n - nuget restore\n - nuget install OpenCover -OutputDirectory packages -Version 4.6.519\nbuild_script:\n - msbuild /verbosity:quiet LetsDisc.sln\ntest_script:\n - .\\packages\\OpenCover.4.6.519\\tools\\OpenCover.Console.exe \n-register:user \n-target:\"C:/Program Files/dotnet/dotnet.exe\" \n-targetargs:\"test --logger:trx;LogFileName=results.trx \n/p:DebugType=full \nC:\\projects\\letsdisc\\test\\LetsDisc.Tests\\LetsDisc.Tests.csproj\" \n-output:\"coverage.xml\" -filter:\"+[LetsDisc*]* -[Tests*]*\"\nafter_test:\n  - ps: |\n      $env:PATH = 'C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin;' + $env:PATH\n      Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://codecov.io/bash' -OutFile codecov.sh\n      bash codecov.sh -f \"coverage.xml\"\n```\n----\n\nThe above script means on every build I will be updating it with a version of 1.0.{buildNumber}, then use Visual Studio 2017 as an image to build the project, then use configuration as release mode and not debug so that it can be easily deployable. Before the build just restoring all the nuget package, as well as installing OpenCover specific version which works with AppVeyor. After that building the project using msbuild and then running my test script to run the tests and create the coverage report. After the test is scuccessful deploying the coverage.xml file to the Codecov website.\n\nIt was fun as well as a learning experiment where I learned to use an Appveyor app as well adding the Coverage report to my project. \n\nRepo : https://github.com/codingdefined/LetsDisc\n\n----\n\n#### Also Published to My Personal Blog: https://www.codingdefined.com/2018/10/how-i-added-appveyor-codecov-to-net.html","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"blog\",\"india\",\"developer\",\"programming\",\"opensource\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/codingdefined\\/LetsDisc\",\"https:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2018\\/10\\/how-i-added-appveyor-codecov-to-net.html\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"b4adbf56-a7c3-5778-aba8-dbf63fe3ceec","title":"Beautiful Sunday Trip to BBQ'D Restaurant","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 14, 2018","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-trip-to-bbq-d-restaurant","body":"Today I visited BBQ'D Restaurant with my friends to attend a party.
