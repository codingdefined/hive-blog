Similarly, I have to do that yesterday. I was getting the DateTime in yyyyMMddhhmmss format which is a very common format in Java. Now I need to convert that to a JavaScript Date for doing some computation on the dates. \n\nThis is where I have to write a bad code where I have to slice Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minutes and Seconds and then using the date class converted it into the JavaScript Date and then computed it with other dates as shown below \n\n`Date.UTC($entity.updated.slice(0, 4), $entity.updated.slice(4, 6) - 1, $entity.updated.slice(6, 8), $entity.updated.slice(8, 10), $entity.updated.slice(10, 12), $entity.updated.slice(12, 14)) >= Date.now().minusDays(7)`\n\nThough I tried to write a good code by writing it in a function, because of SnapLogic limitation, have to write this in ugly format.","created":"October 09, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Bad Code to make Code Work","permlink":"bad-code-to-make-code-work","previous":{"title":"Beautiful Sunday - Cricket Playing","permlink":"beautiful-sunday-cricket-playing-c5dfa78c00afb"},"next":{"title":"Land War on Earth","permlink":"land-war-on-earth"}}}}
