There are lot of users who have found a bug and post that in the Utopian without knowing how the issues are created in the Github, they also does not have account on the Github. Also the Github can revoke your token if it is copied anywhere on the internet. Once the token is revoked you need to sync again with the Github.\n\n#### Proposal\n\nMy proposal is to have a Utopian Github Acoount which does the posting on the User's behalf if the users did not syncd their Utopian account with the Github Account. In that way all the issues will be copied to the github and not only in the Utopian Bug-Hunting Category. Also along with the Issue it can write that Utopian.github created the issue on behalf of @codingdefined.\n\n#### Mockups / Examples\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1517127043/o6tqmrtfasipue0ixrns.png)\n\n#### Benefits\nAs I am a bug moderator I need to check the issue posted before on Utopian as well as on the Github, why because as of now if your Github account is not synced with the Utopian the issue will not be posted on the Github.

A lot of Components like TemplateWrapper, Link, IndexPage etc. \n\nYou might be thinking that what is the use of Components and why its necessary. The answer of this question is the code architecture is simplified for building large websites because then you get some part of the code which can be reused as well as keeping it as simple as possible. \n\nSo a simple example for a Component would be a LinkButton. For creating a link button we would have been using `a` tag and add a href, with some text inside it. Since we are talking about components the best is to create a LinkButton component and whenever we will be using it use it like <LinkButton>This is a LinkButton Component</LinkButton>. Thus your website will be made of components and it is a building block of your Website.\n\n##### Styling Gatsby Website & CSS in Gatsby\n\nSince most of us are familiar with CSS, we will be looking at one of the library which Gatsby Provides and that will help us to do styling in Gatsby. We will be using [Glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) which helps you to write CSS diretly in your components. The advantage of using it is that it helps in resolving th name conflict which we often encounter in normal CSS thus no need to write !important to fix any issue. Since all the CSS elements are tightly coupled with their components it makes it easier to edit those rather than thinking where all the components are being used.\n\nAt first we will install the plugin as `npm install --save gatsby-plugin-glamor` and then add it to the gatsby-config.js as shown below :\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  siteMetadata: {\n    title: 'Gatsby Default Starter',\n  },\n  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-react-helmet', 'gatsby-transformer-json', 'gatsby-plugin-glamor'],\n};\n```\nIn the below code we are using the Glamor where we are writing the inline CSS inside the div element\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\"\nconst UtopianMod = p =>\n  <div\n    css={{\n      display: `flex`,\n      alignItems: `center`\n    }}\n  >\n    <div css={{ flex: 1, marginLeft: 20, padding: 15 }}>\n        {p.modname} : {p.modcategory}\n    </div>\n  </div>\nexport default () => <div>\n    <h1>Utopian Moderator</h1>\n    <UtopianMod\n      modname=\"Coding Defined\"\n      modcategory=\"Review's Development and Bugs\"\n    />\n    <UtopianMod\n      modname=\"ABC\"\n      modcategory=\"Review's XYZ and PQR\"\n    />\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen you run it, it will be shown as where you can see all the css has different tag attached to it, thus making it really easy to update it.\n\n![gatsby3.PNG](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1517050899/xatrpsg31wytne6viabu.png)\n\nNow there is one more option for you if you do not like to use Glamor and that is Styled Components. In styled Components you can write actual CSS element inside your Components and not like Glamor where you will write CSS in the property. It also has the same advantage as Glamor where it helps in resolving the name conflict which we often encounter in normal CSS thus no need to write !important to fix any issue. Since all the CSS elements are tightly coupled with their components it makes it easier to edit those rather than thinking where all the components are being used.\n\nFor working on it you need to install two plugins gatsby-plugin-styled-components and styled-components as shown below\n`npm install --save gatsby-plugin-styled-components styled-components`\n\nSimilarly you need to add it in gatsby-config.js and also styled-components is to be imported in your file.  Now lets say we want our modname and modcategory should be different, so we will write ModWrapper, Modname and ModCategory component and just change the normal CSS with the component.\n\n```\nconst ModWrapper = styled.div`\n  display: `flex`,\n  alignItems: `center`\n`;\nconst Modname = styled.h2`\n  margin: 0 0 15px 0;\n  padding: 0;\n`;\nconst Modcategory = styled.div`\n  flex: 1;\n  margin-left: 20px;\n  padding: 15px;\n`;\nconst User = p => (\n  <ModWrapper >\n      <Modname >{p.modname}</Modname >:\n      <Modcategory >{p.modcategory}</Modcategory >\n  </ModWrapper >\n);\n```\n\n##### Gatsby Plugins\n\nGatsby Plugins are small amounts of JavaScript code which is created by the community members which can be used when you are building Gatsby Sites. There are a lot of plugins available, even though if you like your own plugin you can create that just by writing your own Javascript code. The plugins are easy to install and use thus you do not have to reinvent the wheel of writing everything of your own.\n\nTo install any plugins at first you need to have a npm installed, then you can install it using the command `npm install --save gatsby-transformer-json` where gatsby-transformer-json is a plugin for parsing raw JSON strings into JavaScript objects from JSON files.\n\nNext you need to add it to the gatsby-config.js file as shown below\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  siteMetadata: {\n    title: 'Gatsby Default Starter',\n  },\n  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-react-helmet', 'gatsby-transformer-json'],\n};\n```\n\n#### Curriculum\n\n- [Getting Started With Gatsby.js - Part 1](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-1)\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-2\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"utopian\",\"app\":\"utopian\\/1.0.0\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"repository\":{\"id\":36040894,\"name\":\"gatsby\",\"full_name\":\"gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"html_url\":\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/gatsbyjs\\/gatsby\",\"fork\":false,\"owner\":{\"login\":\"gatsbyjs\"}},\"pullRequests\":[],\"platform\":\"github\",\"type\":\"tutorials\",\"tags\":[\"utopian-io\",\"steemdevs\",\"tutorial\",\"programming\",\"coding\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/threepointone\\/glamor\",\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1517050899\\/xatrpsg31wytne6viabu.png\",\"https:\\/\\/utopian.io\\/utopian-io\\/@codingdefined\\/getting-started-with-gatsby-js-part-1\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/res.cloudinary.com\\/hpiynhbhq\\/image\\/upload\\/v1517050899\\/xatrpsg31wytne6viabu.png\"],\"moderator\":{\"account\":\"amosbastian\",\"time\":\"2018-01-27T23:03:33.795Z\",\"reviewed\":true,\"pending\":false,\"flagged\":false}}"}},{"node":{"id":"b7adb1ec-e7ff-508c-8aa1-d56ba1b1b8ba","title":"B&W Photo Contest - Nature Abstracts - Multiple Entries","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 26, 2018","permlink":"b-and-w-photo-contest-nature-abstracts-multiple-entries","body":"My entries for @davek's B&W photo contest themed \"Nature Abstracts\" with guest judge for this week @dmcamera.\n\n### Entry 1 - From a Train, somewhere near Andhra Pradesh, India\n\n![IMG_20180110_145521_2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeCy9uPxacDybko9PzCXBAodFJbAK4ib2C3aR7Fv46iR6/IMG_20180110_145521_2.jpg)\n\n### Entry 2 - Nandi Hills, Bangalore, India\n\n![IMG_20171126_075502_2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ6aNj12iTbtmmMHHtmRha6Egf836BdgW9NkTXXhAKeXA/IMG_20171126_075502_2.jpg)\n\n### Entry 3 - Udaipur, India\n\n![IMG_20170303_161735554.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPLnno3cxsEQcMVA7RDv6oCcd8cVXvUCcxWEkaMCeZZjU/IMG_20170303_161735554.jpg)\n\n### Camera : Nokia 6","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"bwphotocontest\",\"photography\",\"india\",\"contest\",\"landscapephotography\"],\"users\":[\"davek\",\"dmcamera\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmeCy9uPxacDybko9PzCXBAodFJbAK4ib2C3aR7Fv46iR6\\/IMG_20180110_145521_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ6aNj12iTbtmmMHHtmRha6Egf836BdgW9NkTXXhAKeXA\\/IMG_20171126_075502_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmPLnno3cxsEQcMVA7RDv6oCcd8cVXvUCcxWEkaMCeZZjU\\/IMG_20170303_161735554.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"518942da-5578-56d9-8557-e9607c077e72","title":"Happy Republic Day to All Indians","author":"codingdefined","created":"January 26, 2018","permlink":"happy-republic-day-to-all-indians","body":"### Happy Republic Day Indians \n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus_%28formerly_Victoria_Terminus%29_-_Lit_up_on_Republic_Day_2015_-_Panorama.png)\nSource : wikimedia.org\n\nMy Country India is great like any other country in the world.

So we need a script which will intelligent enough to delete those posts if its finds duplicate or more than one posts by a user in 24 hours.  This will keep the post promotion clean and everyone will get the equal opportunity to promote their posts. \n\n###### Technology Stack\n\nThe application is written in Node.js and we save the data in Sqlite database. Along with that we will use Discordie npm package to talk to Discord API.  Along with this we also use Cluster Npm Package to make the BOT running 24 hours even if it crashes anytime.\n\n###### Code\n\nWe are using Sqlite Database using the NPM package `sqlite3`. So before starting we need to create the table, whenever you run the script it will see if the `posts.db` has been created or not, if not it will create one for you with the Columns required in the script as shown below :\n\n```\nlet db = new sqlite3.Database('posts.db');\ndb.serialize(function() {\n  db.run(\"CREATE TABLE if not exists posts_info\n                         (discordName TEXT, post TEXT, time TEXT, channel_id TEXT)\");\n});\n```\n\nNext we Connect to the Discord using Discordie and whenever we see any incoming messages we will send the event to the Check Posts Function.\n\n```\nclient.connect({\n  token: 'Bot Token'\n});\nclient.Dispatcher.on(Events.GATEWAY_READY, e => {\n  console.log('Connected as: ' + client.User.username);\n});\nclient.Dispatcher.on(Events.MESSAGE_CREATE, e => {\n if (e.message.author.bot) {\n   return;\n}\ncheckPosts(e);\n });\n```\n\nIn the Check Posts function we check if the link is valid i.e. if its from Steemit or Busy, if it is valid we check in the database if the user has added the Posts before by checking the discordName and channel_id. Once we get the posts we check the posts URL and the Time Difference between the earlier post and current post. If everything is correct you can post otherwise the bot will delete the post with a warning.\n\n##### Commits\n\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordSpamRemoval/commit/da4821165749b309b65e8c9b70df1fce146ad331\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordSpamRemoval/commit/6b124748fcf6ff7cb4c5ebc9781349b58de5db57\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordSpamRemoval/commit/c36b504c6280d9ac7220b8f5b367cc2dd3fc7968\n\n###### Bot in Action\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1516698538/i6ba9rwblfjnix41vjtp.png)\n\n\n###### Roadmap\n\nAs of now the Bot will save the Channel ID where the posts have been written along with Discord Name, now if you use more than one discord account you can still spam using the different account. We need to store the Steemit Username, Discord Name, Channel Id, Guild Id and Posts URL to reduce the spamming as much as possible. Create Test Cases and error handling.\n\n###### How to contribute?\n\nThe code is freely available in [Github](https://github.com/codingdefined/DiscordSpamRemoval) which you can fork and create a pull request.
