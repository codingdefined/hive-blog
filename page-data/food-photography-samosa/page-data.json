In India, mostly you will get Vegetarian samosa which is filled with potato, Peas, Onion, Spices, Green chili, Cheese, etc. It's a very common tea time snack out here. It can be of different forms, like triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, usually, in India, you will get it in a triangular form which we have tried at home.\n\nWe do not have to go out to get anything special for this dish, you can prepare it with everything you have at home.\n\nThe below picture is before deep-frying it. The upper coating is of Maida (Refined Wheat Flour) whereas the fillings are of Potato, Onion, Peas, Spices, etc.\n\n![20200422_14500201.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/auvkMfBD-20200422_145002-01.jpeg)\n\n<hr>\n\nThe below picture is after deep frying it and served hot with Green Chili and Tomato Sauce.\n\n![20200422_15082601.jpeg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/codingdefined/BAfpDqZy-20200422_150826-01.jpeg)\n\nThe recipe which we have referred to is, though we have given our own touch based on the available ingredients.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRjb0CWXlpo","created":"April 23, 2020"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Food Photography - Samosa","permlink":"food-photography-samosa","previous":{"title":"Food Photography - Gol Gappe / Puchka","permlink":"food-photography-gol-gappe-puchka"},"next":{"title":"Ways to Save Money","permlink":"ways-to-save-money"}}}}
