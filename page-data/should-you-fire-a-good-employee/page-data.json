He was not applying himself, was making mistakes left and right and stopped caring. My new boss at the time said that this employee had a burn out, and we would be better off without him - but said I should investigate first.\n\nUpon my investigation, it turned out that the employee had lost his father, and his girlfriend had left him for his best friend.
