Diwali is most celebrated festival in India where everyone will light up their home and surroundings, it is just like good fighting the evil.\n\nWe light up our homes to keep the darkness away, we pray to keep everyone healthy, safe and prosperous. We eat without worrying about getting fat and we burn crackers. So as the festive season has started a lot of malls will be decorated, one such mall which I visited today was Garuda Mall in Bangalore.\n\nIn the entrance there was a kind of lighting which denotes a Grand Gate of a palace.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/p2cuv5bkub.jpg)\n\nThen we have few sculptures here and there which are truly art and made by hand.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/5kqo2wi8j8.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/z9zwukrkoh.jpg)\n\nThese shots are not great as I was in a hurry, sorry about that.\n\nCamera : Nokia 6","created":"November 02, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Festivity All Around","permlink":"festivity-all-around-dc8385da11e1b","previous":{"title":"The Power of Faith","permlink":"the-power-of-faith-f8d0951de1fb"},"next":{"title":"A View from the Top - SkyDeck","permlink":"a-view-from-the-top-skydeck-1af30b762b1bf"}}}}
