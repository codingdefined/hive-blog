The traffic was totally out of control just one day before the G20 summit should start because Donald Trump landed today and blocked the whole city centre. I was stuck in traffic for three hours and needed to park outside the area and take the train to reach my destination. I really want to mention that the police officer are doing a great job. You see police trucks, weapons and officers everywhere. In addition at least five helicopters are circling around the town to protect the world leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>--------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>\n<h3>I took some pictures out of my car window to show you what happened today.</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>I literally was staying in that position for over 30 minutes without moving a centimeter!

The G20 summit hasnt even started yet and the town is close to be out of control. ( Not because of the safety, because of the traffic jam )</p>\n<p>I am curious what happens next. For everybody who is in Hamburg right now - Be safe! Do not go into the centre of the city and take care of yourself!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><em>I hope you liked the update, I will let you know if anything spectacular happens</em></h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Source -</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/g20-gipfel-in-hamburg-so-veraendert-der-gipfel-carsharing-mietwagen-und-oepnv-a-1154446.html\">Spiegel Online</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mopo.de/hamburg/g20/verkehrschaos-zu-g20--das-sagt-der-hamburger-senat-zu-einschraenkungen-27784650\">Mopo&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Stay focused</p>\n<p>https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://picload.org/image/rdrlwrgg/ezgif.com-resize.gif</p>\n<p>Love, Soldier</p></center>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n</html>","created":"July 07, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"State Of Emergency - G20 Summit 2017","permlink":"state-of-emergency-g20-summit-2017","previous":{"title":"Do You Need Food?
