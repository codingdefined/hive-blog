Now think about it. This might very well be the last thing you ever do. There is no power in this universe that can guarantee you that you’re going to live for one more second!\n\nRemember all those dreams that you have, that you know you will fulfill. Starting tomorrow, of course. But you damn sure will. And all those burning desires you got kicking around in your head? One day, you’re gonna make all of them a reality. One day!\n\nWhy tomorrow? Why not today? Because you’ve got all the time in the world. Because you just kind of assume that you’re going to live up to 60? Why? Because statistics say that that is what the average human lifespan is. But isn’t that stupid? The average marks of a class might be 60, but ten might still fail. Do you see it? How illogical your assumption is?\n\nIn your head, you build this fantasy, of what you will do tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. You chalk out these beautiful plans of what your life would look like 5 years or 10 years down the line. You visualize them so clearly in your head that you can actually see yourself living that life.\n\nAnd then you go ahead, and use these images to justify your procrastination, your tendency of always living in the future. I’ll ask her out tomorrow. One day when the time is right, I’ll quit my job and start my own startup. You just wait. I’m gonna do it.\n\nBecause in your mind you’ve already done it. Remember those beautiful images? Our innocent brains take them literally. As if all those things have already been achieved. Visualizing something with enough intensity causes the same dopamine rush as actually achieving it. That’s why you feel so good with the images of a fantastic future that you build.\n\nGuess what?\n\nThese images are a lie. A fantasy. A mirage.\n\nLiving up to 60? You don’t even know if you’re going to wake up tomorrow!\n\nAnd you still think you have time?","created":"July 03, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"The trouble is, you think you have time…","permlink":"the-trouble-is-you-think-you-have-time","previous":{"title":"Dispute between India and China","permlink":"dispute-between-india-and-china"},"next":{"title":"Make Yourself a priority","permlink":"make-yourself-a-priority"}}}}
