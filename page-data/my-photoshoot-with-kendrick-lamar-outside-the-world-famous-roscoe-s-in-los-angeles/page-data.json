With that in mind, we had planned to run out to Roscoe's after the shoot to grab some quick candid, improv photo's before we left. Both Kendrick and Roscoe's are both legendary and staples of the Los Angeles culture so it only made sense.\n\nWe were outside with a large group of us when people started to take notice of what was going on. Once that caused attention, the cops came by. With only a few minutes to get these shots and move on, I was able to capture some real, raw, candid shots that have been some of the most iconic photo's I think I've taken to date.\n\nThe greatest thing about this photoshoot to me is the location, how raw and real it is, not having anything planned and just capturing the real Los Angeles vibes. The cop coming by unplanned is just icing on the cake â€” which really makes this that much more real in the era we live in.\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT6Yp4UgQheEcoDyayX9sUuYxP1TyaAbuP2iVyhZ6GiGm/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-3.jpg)\n\n![Kendrick Lamar Outside Roscoe's-2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSQqvo1oCCEUmhJg7KGpWBoNjWW9Q14NGunYgMYJNCZRe/Kendrick%20Lamar%20Outside%20Roscoe's-2.jpg)","created":"July 06, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"My Photoshoot with Kendrick Lamar Outside the World Famous Roscoe's in Los Angeles","permlink":"my-photoshoot-with-kendrick-lamar-outside-the-world-famous-roscoe-s-in-los-angeles","previous":{"title":"Beautiful India #7 - Udaipur City Palace, Rajasthan","permlink":"beautiful-india-7-udaipur-city-palace-rajasthan"},"next":{"title":"Steemvoter Guild: \"Nominate-a-Friend\" for the Guild Vote (Thursday July 6)","permlink":"4cteeo-steemvoter-guild-nominate-a-friend-for-the-guild-vote-tuesday-july-4"}}}}
