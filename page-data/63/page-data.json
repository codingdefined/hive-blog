Many women die every now and then while giving birth. My mother was one of them too, she could not even hold me in her arms. My father was the first person to hold me.. or perhaps the only person.\n\nEveryone was sad.. as I was a girl and I had \"eaten up\" my own mother.\n\nMy dad was instantly asked to remarry but he refused.\n\nMy grandparents forced him by giving all logical, illogical and emotional reasons but he didn't budge.\n\nMy grand parents wanted a grandson, they threatened him to remarry or else he will be disowned...\n\nHe didn't think twice... he left everything, his acres of land.. a good living, comfortable house, cattles and everything that counts for a good lifestyle in a village.\n\nHe came to this huge city with absolutely nothing -- but me in his arms. Life was tough, he worked hard day and night.. raised me with tender love and utmost care.\n\nNow I understand why suddenly he developed a dislike for things that I would love to eat when there was only one piece left in the platter.... he would say that he hates eating it and I would finish it considering that he does not like it.... but as I grew older I realised the reason and what sacrifice is all about.\n\nHe gave me the best possible comforts beyond his capacity.\n\nThis school gave him a shelter, respect and the biggest gift -- an admission to his daughter...\n\nIf love and care defines a mother... then my father fits in there.\n\nIf compassion defines a mother, my father fits in well in that category too...\n\nIf sacrifice defines a mother, my father dominates that category.\n\nSo in nut shell.. if a mother is made of love, care sacrifice and compassion...\n\nMY FATHER IS THE BEST MOTHER ON EARTH THEN.\n\nOn Mother's Day, I would like to wish my father for being the best parent on earth... I salute him and say it with pride that the hardworking gardener working in this school is my father.\n\nI know I may fail this test after my teacher reads this -- but this would be a very small price one would pay towards an ode to the selfless love of my father.\n\nThere was a deafening silence in the room... one could only hear soft sobbing of Ganga Das....\n\nThe harsh sun could not wet his clothes with sweat but soft words of his daughter had soaked his chest with tears.... he was standing there with hands folded..\n\nHe took the paper from teacher's hands... held it close to his heart and sobbed.\n\nPrincipal got up.. offered him a chair, glass of water and said something... but, strangely the crispness of her voice was taken over by a surprising warmth and sweetness....\n\n\"Ganga Das.. your daughter is given 10/10 marks for this essay... This is the best essay ever written about Mother's Day in the history of this school. We are having the Mother's Day gala event tomorrow and the entire School Management has decided to invite you as the Chief Guest for the event...\n\nThis is to honour all the love and sacrifice a man can do to raise his children... to show that you do not have to be a woman to be the perfect parent...\n\nAnd most importantly this is to reinforce/appreciate/acknowledge the strong belief of your daughter in you, to make her feel proud.. to make the entire school feel proud that we have the best parent on earth as stated by your daughter.\"\n\n\"You are a True Gardner, who is not only looking after the gardens, but also nurturing the most precious flower of your life in such a beautiful way....\"\n\n\"So Ganga Das, will you be our Chief Guest for the event?‚Äù","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"steemit\",\"philosophy\",\"writing\",\"india\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3f364ff4-c20c-5d10-89f2-4d8a238655e7","title":"decentralized video hosting","author":"craig-grant","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"decentralized-video-hosting","body":"is great for suicide and murder art","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"art\",\"poerty\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"aa34a214-eea4-5eae-bbda-5af62a8beb33","title":"Cheers !","author":"yuliana","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"388smx-cheers","body":"Beautiful view cheers to that !\n![IMG_1072.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVt54SWGB7sCfuXSibkuDg9KzZXwCzKu1SPb1TJ3QPJB8/IMG_1072.JPG)\n\nDelicious hamburger delivered by Uber eats\n![IMG_1080.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQvHLSgaLHEiS68bbhAfoxNKVjyqsMFp2j9JirBL5eJNp/IMG_1080.JPG)\n\nTwo Mojito's for me \n![IMG_1082.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUmmspcoH76M3c8ne1WtQDZJ3iubpk99cKLtRusdD1L7A/IMG_1082.JPG)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"food\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmVt54SWGB7sCfuXSibkuDg9KzZXwCzKu1SPb1TJ3QPJB8\\/IMG_1072.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQvHLSgaLHEiS68bbhAfoxNKVjyqsMFp2j9JirBL5eJNp\\/IMG_1080.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmUmmspcoH76M3c8ne1WtQDZJ3iubpk99cKLtRusdD1L7A\\/IMG_1082.JPG\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"66c187bb-47c6-5e1d-bb03-ab2f365ed869","title":"Cryptocurrencies Are Now For Sale At All Post Offices In Austria! üá¶üáπ","author":"sirwinchester","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"cryptocurrencies-are-now-for-sale-at-all-post-offices-in-austria","body":"<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/MFYy3B0.jpg)</center>\n<br>\n\n\n2017 has been **the year of cryptocurrencies** - they are finally becoming more and more accepted by the masses. \n### Now, the Austrian Post has just announced that they will offer different cryptocurrencies for sale their locations!\nThey have teamed up with Austrian platform ***BitPanda*** to offer direct exchanges between Euro and cryptocurrencies.

Please only submit posts that are still within their 7 day voting window, and allow enough time for the guild vote to be done before their payout window closes. \n\n+ This is not about curation rewards for the guild members and getting in early on the vote etc, it is purely to reward the deserving author.\n\n+ @steemvoter will consider this a free market experiment and we will facilitate the voting of the post that the community wants voted, without checking for PLG of content, photos and artwork. At our discretion, blatantly inappropriate posts will not be voted on however.\n\n+ This is a beta guild project and terms are subject to change at any time. \n\n# Let's make Steem great ... together!!\n\n <hr>\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexGbcEFRk2RsNjb3g8x3xWFYZuXmNptdAFgEDpThsYGi/image.png)</center>\n\n\n# The Steemvoter Guild\n\nIf you are not already a part of our **[SV Guild](http://www.steemit.com/@steemvoter)** please support our service and the authors we uplift by signing up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/); add your Steem account and make sure the **\"Guild\"** checkbox is enabled for each account you load on the dashboard. \n\nIn addition, you will be able to use our bot service to select your own authors to auto-vote; the guild vote is an additional daily donation to a deserving Steem author. \n\nSteemvoter is a public curation bot with an easy to use interface, it truly is a bot for the people, making automatic curation on Steemit easy with just a few clicks.\n\nThis is a payment post!

Delicious #71 : Murray's Deli at Atlantis, the 1950's style New York-style restaurant!","author":"sweetsssj","created":"July 12, 2017","permlink":"miss-delicious-71-murray-s-deli-at-atlantis-the-1950-s-style-new-york-style-restaurant","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bObivF/IMG_9706.jpg\n\nAs I mentioned before, the Atlantis resort has no shortage of food to delight our tummies, for those of us who are feeling particularly hungry, a visit to [Poseidon's Table](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-68-poseidon-s-table-a-restaurant-worthy-of-gods) for an all-you-can-eat dining experience worthy of Gods is in order. \n\nOthers who feel the need to munch at night time may prefer a visit to [Olives](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-73-a-look-at-the-atlantis-casino-from-a-non-gambler) inside the casino. If you're feeling lucky or have come off a lucky win, then why not dine to celebrate?\n\nFor those of us who prefer some local style cuisine, look no further than a visit to [Bimini Road at Marina Village](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-65-the-hidden-gem-in-atlantis-the-marina-village-and-the-bimini-road-restaurant-photos-video), here I was introduced to the remarkable local Red Snapper, a fish that I now look out for each and every time I dine out. \n\nWe also had the opportunity to get into the nitty gritty with [Virgils BBQ](https://steemit.com/food/@sweetsssj/miss-delicious-70-virgil-s-real-bbq-at-atlantis), a top 10 Southern style BBQ restaurant with hands down some of the best background views in all of Atlantis. The food was on point too, who could resist a serving of oak wood barbecued ribs? I certainly couldn't. \n\n\n\n![murrays.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUvmStgERpk5EhwmaDH75E89hd9xtvo8PcEwUrBxBXnZE/murrays.png)\nSo, today we'll be visiting the food option that many of you will resonate well with. A walk along the front side of Atlantis before leading to Marina village gives us a splendid view of both the Royal Towers and the large yacht dock where many super yachts are parked no doubt to enjoy a day at Atlantis. \n\nI wanted something quick, easy and filling, and I thought to myself what could beat an American New York style diner?\nI made my way through the gigantic building, to the front of the building and walked alongside the Yacht dock to find ***Murray's Deli***. A New York style deli right in the heart of Atlantis. \n\nSince many visitors of Atlantis come from America, they will never feel too far away from home - atleast when it comes to eating familiar foods from their home. For me, New York style food is definitely not the kind of food I eat at home, so it is a welcome experience as any.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gNpLaF/IMG_8111.jpg\nJust opposite our food destination is the harbour / port where you'll see a neat row of absolutely stunning Yachts. Since seeing the Charisma Yacht in my journeys to Exuma, I still dream of owning one of these one day. At least have the pleasure of island hoping around the Bahamas on one!\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jTK8Ua/IMG_8032.jpg\n\nAnd here we are at ***Murray's Deli***. The entrance has a large statue of an Italian looking waiter. Strangely, the desk at the front is actually for paying the bill and not for reserving a table. I queued up for 10 minutes to find that out..\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/huoz2v/DSC00982.jpg\n\nFurther inside, there is a lovely high top table just in front of the open plan kitchen. Diners wishing to see how their food is prepared can sit up close and not wait for the waiter to bring the food to their table.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/in73Ua/DSC00987.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cGBaaF/DSC00998.jpg\n\nLong rows of tables form the usual seating arrangement. There is very little space between each table which suggests that dining close quarters is welcome and probably quite frequent!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ehkq9a/DSC00983.jpg\n\nOn one end of the bar, there is a bakery which has a lovely selection of cakes and desserts which you can pick up yourself, and even take away.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/ddnsNv/DSC00999.jpg\n\nAll of the tables also use a multi-coloured sofa as seats. Some are circular, whilst others just follow the lines of the restaurant tables. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iMMcNv/IMG_8042.jpg\n\nI really like this wooden palm tree behind the waiter.  It's a lovely carved design and doubles up as a decorative lighting fixture. \n\n![IMG_8109.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf6iDZe7z6NvBeE8Gg5uGkxf1xG57Uxj2RPDe6YC2ykR9/IMG_8109.jpg)\n\nLike with most diners, the sauces such as Heinz Tomato Ketchup, Mayonnaise, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper and Mustard are provided on the table for you to garnish your food as you wish. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iDY2pa/IMG_8037.jpg\n\nThis is the menu which has a picture of downtown New York on the front and it's signature Yellow taxis!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gH2HNv/IMG_8036.jpg\n\nAs you can see from the *Menu*, ***Murray's Deli*** specialises in deli sandwiches.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/h2nTUa/IMG_8041.jpg\n\nThey also have a nice selection of Desserts and Sundaes.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jZZ8Ua/IMG_8040.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fJcTUa/IMG_8039.jpg\n\nI was surprised to see *Dr Browns Cream Soda* on the drinks menu. In my very limited experience of drinking Cream Soda, I've always loved it very much. With the temperature outside averaging 35 degrees Celsius, this was a much needed refreshment.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jnoP2v/IMG_8043.jpg\n\nAlong with the refreshing Cream Soda, I ordered the ***Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad***. I must say, I am extremely impressed with not only the fresh taste of the lettuce, but also the generous serving of grilled chicken. I could probably be happy with just this salad honestly!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jqua9a/IMG_8050.jpg\nNext up, the main! \n\n***Club Atlantean Bacon Sandwich served on a bed of fries***.  How could anyone resist such delicious Bacon and freshly fried fries? Again, the serving of Bacon was very generous, it was so delicious that I decided to eat it on it's own without the bread. \nhttp://image.ibb.co/bWwcNv/IMG_8105.jpg\n\n***Murray's Big Beef Dip***. The most meaty choice for beef lovers. This sandwich is served with Provolone cheese, sliced roast beef and beef gravy. What I liked most about this dish was the gravy which had such a rich taste of beef. The cheese was getting a little overwhelming so the gravy helped balance it out quite alot!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gwaF9a/IMG_8108.jpg\n\nFood is one of life's guilty pleasures. On this day, I feel no what guilt whatsoever. Good food comes in all shapes and sizes and Murray's Deli does not fail to impress!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hnua9a/IMG_9708.jpg\n\nThank you for joining me on a tour of Atlantis' very own New York style deli. Now you have no excuse to be missing food from home. I certainly didn't and I don't even eat this stuff regularly!\n\nStay tuned for the next edition of Miss. Delicious!

We believe the ecosystem of the whole platform will not be developed sustainably unless developers productivity could be promoted. Asch is also an open platform whose focus is not limited to a particular area, such as finance, document storage, or copywrite proof, but is on providing a series of underlying and abstract APIs, which can be combined and utilized to realize almost all kinds of applications. In addition Asch system utilized enhenced DPOS agorithm in its consensus mechanism to significantly reduce the probability of block fork and the risk of duplicate payment. Most importantly, Asch's sidechain-is-application mode can not only alleviate the blockchain inflation issue, but also make DApp more'\n\n* @virtualgrowth is doing a weekly market update and token give away; Check out his post and vote on your favorite asset [HERE](https://steemit.com/bitshares/@virtualgrowth/steem-bts-and-asset-market-update-7-12-and-giveaway-for-7-19)\n\n* This weeks Bitshares hangout recording has been published and is available [HERE](https://steemit.com/beyondbitcoin/@africa/bitshares-hangout-2017-07-07-beyond-bitcoin-radioshow-raw-recording-for-impatients)\n\n* Current registered wallets/accounts within the Bitshares network is 369317; an increase of 8011 wallets/accounts since last week\n\n* The last asset registered this week is asset #1498 and it is named 'AVERS' registered by 'aversis' with the description 'Settlement unit for Aversis software' googling leads me to [aversis.net/](https://aversis.net/) this seems like a good fit but may not be the actual projects website. \n\n\n#### Smartcoin issueance chart showing weekly change since the start of 2017\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qcPLnE2.png)\n\n#### Openledger team\n![](http://i.imgur.com/RtzmwFR.png)\n\n#### Bitshares telegram user Jonas has received some Bitshares Swag ('BTS HODLER' Shirt, Hat and phone cover)\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Q05HiWO.png)\n\n#### Worker Proposal presented by the Bitshares Blockchain Foundation.
