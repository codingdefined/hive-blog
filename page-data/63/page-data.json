Adhering to the traffic signal itself is a task that proves too difficult for most people. And in a country where flouting traffic rules is so widespread, accidents and mishaps are commonplace. Instead of blaming the government and whining about it, it’s about time that we started paying heed to Road Safety so that we can make our roads safer and more enjoyable to drive/ride on.\n\nYou might have noticed that some road markings are either white or yellow and sometimes they are continuous or broken. Each of these road markings in India are actually different signs that grant varying permissions to drivers on the road. Here’s what each one of them means.\n\nBroken White Line\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQmJh2VCkEP1g672QpbE7nwVAvy2M5HXTvFHwKByEi5bu/image.png)\n\nThe most common of road markings in India, a broken white line indicates that you may change lanes, overtake vehicles or make a U-turn after seeing that it is safe to do so.\n\nSolid White Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRajTTg9xTw41iXCuGuCV3kGvcV7r6byzpVs3CsoSmozR/image.png)\n\nYou cannot overtake a vehicle or make a U-turn if your on a road with a continuous white line. However, you may cross the line to avoid an obstruction or to exit the road to enter a perpendicular road.\n\nDouble Yellow Lines - Road Markings in India :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ6h5Ejxw4ccuZptwdJZUS8NpgS4fkbyZRvVXNScqnvaq/image.png)\n\nDouble Yellow lines can never be crossed unless it is to avoid a major obstruction. Usually used on 2-lane roads, it’s used to prevent crossing over into the lane with traffic going in the opposite direction.\n\nSingle Yellow Line next to a Broken Yellow Line :\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY3DLd1dom4PZ2mVaYriTbbbU6CXBEm4fZv1dwxpSfJeC/image.png)\n\nThis type of road marking combines the rules of the first two markings in this list. If you are driving on the side with the broken line, you are allowed to overtake and if you’re driving on the side of the solid line, you’re not.\n\nNow, you are more theoretically qualified to be driving or riding on Indian roads than majority of the public. The next time you’re out on the road, see if you can follow these rules or spot anyone doing so.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"road\",\"life\",\"nature\",\"meaning\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmS597CPRRmS3c9mPo6fnbogwkiavUtj74En43c3zdK2z6\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQmJh2VCkEP1g672QpbE7nwVAvy2M5HXTvFHwKByEi5bu\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRajTTg9xTw41iXCuGuCV3kGvcV7r6byzpVs3CsoSmozR\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQ6h5Ejxw4ccuZptwdJZUS8NpgS4fkbyZRvVXNScqnvaq\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmY3DLd1dom4PZ2mVaYriTbbbU6CXBEm4fZv1dwxpSfJeC\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3febcb38-7691-5d8e-97ff-ab81d7d3a130","title":"My photography - Mushrooms (Original) 捡磨菇","author":"birds90","created":"July 14, 2017","permlink":"7qh3q-my-photography-mushrooms-original","body":"I have shoot a lot of mushrooms photos, want to shoot these mushrooms, the best time, after 24 hours of heavy rain,They are usually grown in Bamboo forest,damp,the cool place，There are many varieties of mushrooms, wild mushroom many are toxic and bacteria,So need to dry processing, and then eat,Together to enjoy\n以前我也拍过许多的磨菇，想要拍摄这些磨菇，最好的时间，是大雨过后的24小时内，它们一般生长在竹林，潮湿，阴凉的地方或者枯树上，磨菇有许多品种，野生的磨菇许多都有毒性和细菌，所以一般都是晒干加工，再食用，可食用的磨菇都很鲜美，一起来欣赏<br>\n\nThis is bamboo mushroom I found in the bamboo forest, is edible, nutrient-rich, the price is also very expensive\n这是竹林里发现的竹荪蘑菇，竹荪是可以食用，营养丰富，售价也很贵 <br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-279.jpg<br>\nThis mushroom looks good, but I do not know, do not pick it\n这种蘑菇长得很好看，但我不认识，不去摘它<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-192.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-190.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-191.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-280.jpg<br>\n\n\n\nIn our local people called the chicken for grams of mushroom, can eat, after the rain, people will go up the mountain to pick this mushroom\n这个在我们这里当地叫人称为鸡枞克的磨菇，可以食用，大雨过后，人们都会上山去捡<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-080.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-079.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-078.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-073-1.jpg<br>\nhttp://steemit.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/125-077.jpg<br>\n\n无论它们长得有多大，还是多好看, 不要轻易食用不认识的菌类<br>\nHope you like!","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"photography\",\"cn\",\"nature\",\"life\",\"food\"],\"image\":[\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-279.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-192.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-190.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-191.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-280.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-080.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-079.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-078.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-073-1.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/steemit.marketing\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2017\\/07\\/125-077.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"f7bd91c7-6492-536c-86bd-dcb82feca243","title":"Travel with me #78 : A visit to the magnificent Rose Island, Sandy Toes and snorkeling with Lion Fish!","author":"sweetsssj","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"travel-with-me-78-a-visit-to-the-magnificent-rose-island-sandy-toes-and-snorkeling-with-lion-fish","body":"### Dear Steemit friends :\n\n![IMG_0548.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY8pnFGdtBcQXtoLhTD1i8XhLzqvyqcyy45vAz32wUJWG/IMG_0548.jpg)\n\nOne of the best things about Bahamas is how many beautiful exotic islands there are. In fact, there are over 700 islands and islets which constitute the country that is Bahamas. Each have their own unique pedigree but I'm sure most visitors to Bahamas will agree that they are all largely unspoiled and very picturesque!\n\nI haven't had much time to explore all the islands on this trip, but I did have the opportunity to visit the main ones like [Compass Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay), [Major Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs) and [Exuma Cays](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video).  Each had their own little surprises which are definitely worth a visit!\n\nWith so much to see and do, you might be wondering whether I had the opportunity to just enjoy the tropical weather, chill on the beach, swim in the sea and relax? The answer to that is yes! \n\nI had the pleasure of visiting ***Rose Island, Sandy Toes*** and spend a day sipping cocktails by the beach, and swimming in the sea! Many would say that's the ideal activity for such a vacation and I must say - I agree!\nhttps://image.ibb.co/dS0dqF/IMG_8023.jpg\n\n\n![DSC02068.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQ81pNb12ovYRUMaYeZrdQfYaW5dwpdMqohPSyAUkHKnr/DSC02068.JPG)\n\nThe day started very early, I woke up around 7am to another gorgeous day brimming with sunshine and was ready for a lazy relaxing day at the private island known for it's pink sands!\n\nThe excursion was very easy to book, you can either book at your hotel, over the internet, or just turn up at the port where the boat leaves. Of course, I like to make sure everything is booked up in advance so I booked my excursion the very first day I arrived.  \n\nhttps://image.ibb.co/cZWUxv/IMG_8022.jpg\n\n![DSC02046.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSQda931aEthBzm7gEVtZSV9kNhCUCLy54SaC8wdMWzXm/DSC02046.JPG)\n\nThe gathering point for the boat trip is Magaritaville, a very popular restaurant and bar at the edge of Paradise Island. \n\n![DSC02043.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZSXw31d8ZKvC69xuXnnwPmHtisRNqz7eKkCfJfAZJP3g/DSC02043.JPG)\n\nJust beside Magaritaville, is the port where all of the boats are docked ready to take people all around Bahamas.\n\nThe bridge in the picture connects Nassau to Paradise Island and is quite impressive! \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kUEvKa/IMG_0497.jpg\n\nFor this trip, a speedboat wasn't necessary because there were probably around 50 other people coming as well.\nThe boat gently pulls out from the dock and makes it's way at moderate speed through the harbour towards the open seas. \n\n![DSC02050.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ7QqB5mHUfizmGg5UNpgsMuZGXCwmMhseZjAF1ytM9Wm/DSC02050.JPG)\n\nOnly 15 minutes later, we're already arriving at Rose Island. The boat trip was short and actually very pleasant. Before docking, we drove along the long elongated island and saw very few man made buildings there. It certainly looks like a paradise waiting for me to explore!\n\n![DSC02085.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmf8eWHbHSJS1HjPn6ahy8rRy9EH76PWRdTxBDtbNbMYHB/DSC02085.JPG)\n\nThe boat pulls over at what looks like the only dock on the island and we all disembark the boat immediately clamouring up the side of the hill ready to explore.\n\n![DSC02096.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPYQBMwSuZT7g5GjcmyYifm3ynEZ6HREnhx2wzS5K8H4U/DSC02096.JPG)\n\n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k7rLkF/IMG_0498.jpg\n\n![DSC02097.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaLXTQnd2w5fKPTgx5hb56VM3ABxqRf3BHazrv5WLAYh7/DSC02097.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nfJpea/IMG_0499.jpg\n\nTo my surprise, I was greeted by a bunch of free roaming chickens! \n\n![DSC02102.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQme9z7cWH4FzoSR7BAiKSAc76ADUFSCYwHbPffZ2wt8hjf/DSC02102.JPG)\n\nA small narrow passage connects between the landing area and the beach. It's all very natural and walking through, I felt like I was trekking through a small forest with Chickens watching my every step. How peculiar! \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hpdpea/IMG_0500.jpg\n\nAmazingly, there were also quite a number of peacocks just chilling in the shade.  Coming so close to them, I'm amazed by their beautiful plumage. They are even more beautiful in person than the pictures could show.\n\n![DSC02113.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZ3nwq8nqGb9hR41pXxaLdMAYR5cBFP9BSqLcDAPQpLQD/DSC02113.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/dM46QF/IMG_0501.jpg\n\n![DSC02116.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVo2Z2yEfyybybqHShzVWHCGsefibq2WjdbtWDurhVojP/DSC02116.JPG)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/nr6xXv/IMG_0502.jpg\n\n![DSC02117.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmWvCsnsn9YASwZ3rfrtbnYjdrjzoG1kvJ9coEERvkt6Ap/DSC02117.JPG)\n\n![DSC02120.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSRpKAKkCXXvsrHGKE7M3V8iB5ADJ72uCvomXBXkkzPPt/DSC02120.JPG)\n\nAt the end of the little passage, we arrive at the beach bar and massage area which overlooks the sea and beautiful beach. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mUiNza/IMG_0503.jpg\n\nAs you can imagine, i'm a little anxious to get my my feet wet!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hOarsv/IMG_0504.jpg\n\nI was really blown away by the beautiful and natural setting. All around, there are these beautiful rock formations that have been left untouched preserving their beauty.\n\nIn the distance, you can see a neighbouring island like a mirage unveiled before your eyes.\n\n![DSC02269.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdwnN8emJyehBWovc8QoFBAvvQm4MdLzaAE8Q38e8A8Ez/DSC02269.JPG)\n\nOne of the best aspects about Rose Island is that it is a private island. This means there are virtually no people there and you can have so much of the beach to yourself. Exclusivity aside, the name ***Rose Island*** also comes from the fact that here, you will find the sandy beaches tinted in a slightly Rose colour. Sometimes, it's even called ***\"Pink Sands\"***.\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eJjh0F/IMG_8708.jpg\n\nThe skies were absolutely amazing, whilst the sun toasted my skin and added to my already darkening skin tone, I kicked back for a moment to enjoy the neon-blue skies, threaded by heavenly white puffy clouds. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eD6vLF/IMG_8695.jpg\n\nWith such scenic and idyllic surroundings, it's hard to resist jumping for joy... \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/gyTY5F/IMG_0506.jpg\n\nBefore long, I felt the need to take a dip in the calm and tranquil water. Like most other islands in Bahamas, the water clarity is something to me marvelled at. \n\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/k9nXza/IMG_0529.jpg\n\nJust around this rock formation, you can see the coral reefs through the crystal clear water. It's amazing how the water blends from a yellow colour and through a gradient all the way to the tiffany blue colour you see further out. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/kYV0nv/IMG_8707.jpg\n\nPerfect opportunity for some on the fly photoshoots!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/eDraKa/IMG_0510.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hoBUfF/IMG_8702.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/frjjCv/IMG_0523.jpg\n\nI really can't hold down my excitement so more jumping is due!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/iLq2za/IMG_0516.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/i3YBsv/IMG_0515.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/d152za/IMG_0513.jpg\n\nAfter some time at the beach, the hosts kindly invited us over for some impromptu island lunch. \n\nMost people were happy to sit in the shade, but look at that view from the balcony! \n\n![IMG_8727.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYoJ5iHSWybWiipGXaemtcrUyJ8c5haiUko7HDRqv8hBe/IMG_8727.jpg)\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cFWqnv/IMG_8739.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/j1bO7v/IMG_8738.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/cNbZEa/IMG_8737.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/hRPbSv/IMG_8736.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fHSVnv/IMG_8735.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/mFPMua/IMG_8734.jpg\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bOpnZa/IMG_8733.jpg\n\nAfter lunch, we had a couple more hours to enjoy the beach, but for more the more adventurous of us, we had the option of doing some light snorkelling around the island. \n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/jQMaKa/IMG_0512.jpg\n\nThe ideal snorkelling spot is just around that rock where the corals and reefs are.\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3XQpQko.gif\n</center>\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/bRBaKa/IMG_0511.jpg\n\nIf you don't have your own gear, then they are happy to provide you with it for a small deposit.\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JhCeyRA.gif\n</center>\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/krV2za/IMG_0508.jpg\n\n<center>\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vyhmKh7.gif\n</center>\n\n### Be sure to check out my video of my snorkelling adventure! Look out for the Lion Fish!\nhttps://youtu.be/PAXAiXZCqcc\n\nI made sure to leave a mark on the island before I left!\n\nhttp://image.ibb.co/fvZChv/AEBA2_AFA_B49_B_4_FA2_A7_DF_8_B6_D7_B872909.jpg\n\nAnd that wraps up my day at Rose Island, Sandy Toes! After travelling around all over Bahamas, this one day mini escape to a private island was a much needed time to relax.  I can't stress how beautiful the island is with it's roaming chickens, peacocks and myriad of natural fish swimming around the surrounding corals. If or when you visit Bahamas, I highly recommend taking one day to enjoy this little gem of an island for a truly memorable day of pure relaxation!\n\nBe sure to upvote if you liked my post, follow

Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video)喂了漂亮的小蜥蜴，去了[Big Major Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs)和会游泳的小猪一起玩水，最后还去到了[Compass Cay](https://steemit.com/travel/@sweetsssj/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay)和水里的猛兽鲨鱼来了此彻彻底底的亲密接触。\n\n其实我知道巴哈马的招牌活动，除了和小猪一起游泳，另一个不得不去的就是粉色沙滩了。全世界唯一一片粉红色的沙滩，是因为海水冲刷红珊瑚而形成的，这里是度假天堂，也是拍照圣地。这片传说中的人间仙境位于巴哈马的Harbour Island东边，它有一个浪漫的不得了的名字——Rose Island玫瑰岛。这个保护这个地球上的粉色珍珠海滩，当地旅游公司实行了限制登岛流量的政策，每天只有50个人左右可以登上这个岛。所以我几乎提前一周，就预约了去岛上玩。今天我们就坐着小船，去探索一下最美丽的粉色沙滩吧，我已经兴奋的按捺不住了。今天我们要去玫瑰岛上的Sandy Toes沙滩的脚尖，这个名字是不是太有创意了。在船上，可以看到两岸一排排富人的别墅小洋房，白色，粉色的真漂亮，这25座色彩斑斓的小别墅融合了摩洛哥，印度和印尼巴厘岛等多种风格。船上放着欢快的音乐，游客们不自觉地跟着舞蹈起来，不一会就到了玫瑰岛。让我意料之外的是，岛上除了有最美颜色的沙滩，原来还有小鸡和孔雀，我赶紧过去和它们照相，孔雀的羽毛在阳光下闪闪发光。岛上的人们为了欢迎我们，还准备的欢迎的饮料，芒果味的鸡尾酒喝下去身体真清凉。顺着岛上各种形态的椰子树，就走到了海滩，海滩边还有一个酒吧，我们买了无限畅饮票的还可以一直喝饮料和酒水，真的太清凉了。这片粉色沙滩长约3英里，真正的粉色沙砾成了它的最大特点。再看看海水的颜色，在阳光下不停变换着它的颜色。到了中午用餐的时间，岛上的工作人员端来大盆的沙拉，热狗，还有烤鸡肉当作自助餐，坐在这样的美景前面，彻底陶醉了，都快要忘记吃饭了。\n\n这片岛除了是拍照圣地，还是浮浅的天堂。现在大家就跟随我的脚步，跳进海里，看看海底世界吧，希望大家喜欢我做的视频，别忘了看看我在水下拍摄的狮子鱼，这是我第一次有机会这么近距离看到这种鱼，它主要分布在东北部大西洋区，别看它长得美到像一朵盛开的菊花，它可是是吃肉的，以甲壳类为主要食物，如果不是它看到我过来，赶快沉到海底，我好像伸手过去摸摸它。希望大家很享受今天带大家体验的粉色沙滩之旅，之后还有更多有趣的美景和故事要分享给大家。","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"travel\",\"life\",\"photography\",\"blog\",\"cn\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmY8pnFGdtBcQXtoLhTD1i8XhLzqvyqcyy45vAz32wUJWG\\/IMG_0548.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/dS0dqF\\/IMG_8023.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQ81pNb12ovYRUMaYeZrdQfYaW5dwpdMqohPSyAUkHKnr\\/DSC02068.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cZWUxv\\/IMG_8022.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSQda931aEthBzm7gEVtZSV9kNhCUCLy54SaC8wdMWzXm\\/DSC02046.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZSXw31d8ZKvC69xuXnnwPmHtisRNqz7eKkCfJfAZJP3g\\/DSC02043.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/kUEvKa\\/IMG_0497.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ7QqB5mHUfizmGg5UNpgsMuZGXCwmMhseZjAF1ytM9Wm\\/DSC02050.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmf8eWHbHSJS1HjPn6ahy8rRy9EH76PWRdTxBDtbNbMYHB\\/DSC02085.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmPYQBMwSuZT7g5GjcmyYifm3ynEZ6HREnhx2wzS5K8H4U\\/DSC02096.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/k7rLkF\\/IMG_0498.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaLXTQnd2w5fKPTgx5hb56VM3ABxqRf3BHazrv5WLAYh7\\/DSC02097.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/nfJpea\\/IMG_0499.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQme9z7cWH4FzoSR7BAiKSAc76ADUFSCYwHbPffZ2wt8hjf\\/DSC02102.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hpdpea\\/IMG_0500.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZ3nwq8nqGb9hR41pXxaLdMAYR5cBFP9BSqLcDAPQpLQD\\/DSC02113.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/dM46QF\\/IMG_0501.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmVo2Z2yEfyybybqHShzVWHCGsefibq2WjdbtWDurhVojP\\/DSC02116.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/nr6xXv\\/IMG_0502.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmWvCsnsn9YASwZ3rfrtbnYjdrjzoG1kvJ9coEERvkt6Ap\\/DSC02117.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSRpKAKkCXXvsrHGKE7M3V8iB5ADJ72uCvomXBXkkzPPt\\/DSC02120.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/mUiNza\\/IMG_0503.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hOarsv\\/IMG_0504.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmdwnN8emJyehBWovc8QoFBAvvQm4MdLzaAE8Q38e8A8Ez\\/DSC02269.JPG\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eJjh0F\\/IMG_8708.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eD6vLF\\/IMG_8695.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/gyTY5F\\/IMG_0506.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/k9nXza\\/IMG_0529.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/kYV0nv\\/IMG_8707.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/eDraKa\\/IMG_0510.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hoBUfF\\/IMG_8702.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/frjjCv\\/IMG_0523.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/iLq2za\\/IMG_0516.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/i3YBsv\\/IMG_0515.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/d152za\\/IMG_0513.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmYoJ5iHSWybWiipGXaemtcrUyJ8c5haiUko7HDRqv8hBe\\/IMG_8727.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cFWqnv\\/IMG_8739.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/j1bO7v\\/IMG_8738.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/cNbZEa\\/IMG_8737.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/hRPbSv\\/IMG_8736.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/fHSVnv\\/IMG_8735.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/mFPMua\\/IMG_8734.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/bOpnZa\\/IMG_8733.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/jQMaKa\\/IMG_0512.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/3XQpQko.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/bRBaKa\\/IMG_0511.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/JhCeyRA.gif\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/krV2za\\/IMG_0508.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/vyhmKh7.gif\",\"https:\\/\\/img.youtube.com\\/vi\\/PAXAiXZCqcc\\/0.jpg\",\"http:\\/\\/image.ibb.co\\/fvZChv\\/AEBA2_AFA_B49_B_4_FA2_A7_DF_8_B6_D7_B872909.jpg\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-76-swimming-with-the-sharks-at-compass-cay\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-72-visiting-major-cay-and-taking-a-swim-with-the-pigs\",\"https:\\/\\/steemit.com\\/travel\\/@sweetsssj\\/travel-with-me-71-powerboating-to-exuma-cays-feeding-the-iguanas-photos-video\",\"https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/PAXAiXZCqcc\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"753c7768-72b7-59ad-86ca-188a9d539ba4","title":"Random

Many women die every now and then while giving birth. My mother was one of them too, she could not even hold me in her arms. My father was the first person to hold me.. or perhaps the only person.\n\nEveryone was sad.. as I was a girl and I had \"eaten up\" my own mother.\n\nMy dad was instantly asked to remarry but he refused.\n\nMy grandparents forced him by giving all logical, illogical and emotional reasons but he didn't budge.\n\nMy grand parents wanted a grandson, they threatened him to remarry or else he will be disowned...\n\nHe didn't think twice... he left everything, his acres of land.. a good living, comfortable house, cattles and everything that counts for a good lifestyle in a village.\n\nHe came to this huge city with absolutely nothing -- but me in his arms. Life was tough, he worked hard day and night.. raised me with tender love and utmost care.\n\nNow I understand why suddenly he developed a dislike for things that I would love to eat when there was only one piece left in the platter.... he would say that he hates eating it and I would finish it considering that he does not like it.... but as I grew older I realised the reason and what sacrifice is all about.\n\nHe gave me the best possible comforts beyond his capacity.\n\nThis school gave him a shelter, respect and the biggest gift -- an admission to his daughter...\n\nIf love and care defines a mother... then my father fits in there.\n\nIf compassion defines a mother, my father fits in well in that category too...\n\nIf sacrifice defines a mother, my father dominates that category.\n\nSo in nut shell.. if a mother is made of love, care sacrifice and compassion...\n\nMY FATHER IS THE BEST MOTHER ON EARTH THEN.\n\nOn Mother's Day, I would like to wish my father for being the best parent on earth... I salute him and say it with pride that the hardworking gardener working in this school is my father.\n\nI know I may fail this test after my teacher reads this -- but this would be a very small price one would pay towards an ode to the selfless love of my father.\n\nThere was a deafening silence in the room... one could only hear soft sobbing of Ganga Das....\n\nThe harsh sun could not wet his clothes with sweat but soft words of his daughter had soaked his chest with tears.... he was standing there with hands folded..\n\nHe took the paper from teacher's hands... held it close to his heart and sobbed.\n\nPrincipal got up.. offered him a chair, glass of water and said something... but, strangely the crispness of her voice was taken over by a surprising warmth and sweetness....\n\n\"Ganga Das.. your daughter is given 10/10 marks for this essay... This is the best essay ever written about Mother's Day in the history of this school. We are having the Mother's Day gala event tomorrow and the entire School Management has decided to invite you as the Chief Guest for the event...\n\nThis is to honour all the love and sacrifice a man can do to raise his children... to show that you do not have to be a woman to be the perfect parent...\n\nAnd most importantly this is to reinforce/appreciate/acknowledge the strong belief of your daughter in you, to make her feel proud.. to make the entire school feel proud that we have the best parent on earth as stated by your daughter.\"\n\n\"You are a True Gardner, who is not only looking after the gardens, but also nurturing the most precious flower of your life in such a beautiful way....\"\n\n\"So Ganga Das, will you be our Chief Guest for the event?”","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"steemit\",\"philosophy\",\"writing\",\"india\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"2826e7d6-2854-509b-bb4d-5d83874d5b5d","title":"decentralized video hosting","author":"craig-grant","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"decentralized-video-hosting","body":"is great for suicide and murder art","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"art\",\"poerty\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"30f527ce-b3fb-53f7-8a12-5a63e64147fc","title":"Cheers !","author":"yuliana","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"388smx-cheers","body":"Beautiful view cheers to that !\n![IMG_1072.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVt54SWGB7sCfuXSibkuDg9KzZXwCzKu1SPb1TJ3QPJB8/IMG_1072.JPG)\n\nDelicious hamburger delivered by Uber eats\n![IMG_1080.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQvHLSgaLHEiS68bbhAfoxNKVjyqsMFp2j9JirBL5eJNp/IMG_1080.JPG)\n\nTwo Mojito's for me \n![IMG_1082.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUmmspcoH76M3c8ne1WtQDZJ3iubpk99cKLtRusdD1L7A/IMG_1082.JPG)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"life\",\"food\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmVt54SWGB7sCfuXSibkuDg9KzZXwCzKu1SPb1TJ3QPJB8\\/IMG_1072.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQvHLSgaLHEiS68bbhAfoxNKVjyqsMFp2j9JirBL5eJNp\\/IMG_1080.JPG\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmUmmspcoH76M3c8ne1WtQDZJ3iubpk99cKLtRusdD1L7A\\/IMG_1082.JPG\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"4cb239c1-f483-5435-b0a2-00d61e1fdf0d","title":"Cryptocurrencies Are Now For Sale At All Post Offices In Austria! 🇦🇹","author":"sirwinchester","created":"July 13, 2017","permlink":"cryptocurrencies-are-now-for-sale-at-all-post-offices-in-austria","body":"<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/MFYy3B0.jpg)</center>\n<br>\n\n\n2017 has been **the year of cryptocurrencies** - they are finally becoming more and more accepted by the masses. \n### Now, the Austrian Post has just announced that they will offer different cryptocurrencies for sale their locations!\nThey have teamed up with Austrian platform ***BitPanda*** to offer direct exchanges between Euro and cryptocurrencies.

Simple ... reply with a comment to this post with the link to another Steemian's post you think deserves the daily Steemvoter guild upvote, you are welcome to motivate in the reply why you think they deserve it. \n\nThe reply with the highest upvote $ value will be the winner and the post nominated in that reply will receive the guild upvote, which as you may have seen from previous posts, is a generous upvote from over 500 guild members, giving $100 dollars or more to the author depending on starting value.\n\nPlease make sure your nomination follows these guidelines:\n\n## Two  Winner Trial Test\n\nWe are currently voting the top two winning nominations at an equal vote weight each. \n\n## Basic Guidelines\n\n+ **You cannot submit your own post or that of your other related accounts that you own or share ownership in**, if you are found or reported to do this and substantially verified, your and your related accounts will be blacklisted from future guild vote eligibility. \n\n+ No religious, NSFW, racist, trolling, fake news or inappropriate posts will be considered, in which case runner's up will be selected. @steemvoter has the final word as to which post is selected for the daily vote.\n\n+ We will not vote the same author in a seven-day window.\n\n+ **Cut-off time:** We will choose the highest value comment nomination within 48 hours of this post becoming active. Please only submit posts that are still within their 7 day voting window, and allow enough time for the guild vote to be done before their payout window closes. \n\n+ This is not about curation rewards for the guild members and getting in early on the vote etc, it is purely to reward the deserving author.\n\n+ @steemvoter will consider this a free market experiment and we will facilitate the voting of the post that the community wants voted, without checking for PLG of content, photos and artwork. At our discretion, blatantly inappropriate posts will not be voted on however.\n\n+ This is a beta guild project and terms are subject to change at any time. \n\n# Let's make Steem great ... together!!\n\n <hr>\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexGbcEFRk2RsNjb3g8x3xWFYZuXmNptdAFgEDpThsYGi/image.png)</center>\n\n\n# The Steemvoter Guild\n\nIf you are not already a part of our **[SV Guild](http://www.steemit.com/@steemvoter)** please support our service and the authors we uplift by signing up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/); add your Steem account and make sure the **\"Guild\"** checkbox is enabled for each account you load on the dashboard. \n\nIn addition, you will be able to use our bot service to select your own authors to auto-vote; the guild vote is an additional daily donation to a deserving Steem author. \n\nSteemvoter is a public curation bot with an easy to use interface, it truly is a bot for the people, making automatic curation on Steemit easy with just a few clicks.\n\nThis is a payment post! Thank you for allowing us to use your Steem accounts to upvote this post by virtue of your free subscription to our bot service! \n\nAnyone not signed up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/) is welcome to do so or just vote this post to help the project.\n\n**And if you missed it, be sure to check out our [Steemvoter Week In Review for June 19 - 24](https://steemit.com/steemvoter/@steemvoter/steemvoter-week-in-review-for-june-19-24) for previous guild vote winners & Steemvoter news.**\n\n<hr>\n\n## Paying for Premium Services with Bitcoin and other Alt Coins\n\nOur premium services allow you up to 500 voting rules regardless of your Steem Power holdings, and exempts you from our daily self-vote payment posts, however you can still choose to add the @steemvoter account to your rules and decide your own timing to vote our posts. To pay for premium services send 3 SBD to the @steemvoter account for a one month subscription or multiples of 3 SBD for a bulk payment. \n\nWe have been asked recently if we accept Bitcoin as payment, the [blocktrades.us](https://www.blocktrades.us/) service allows you to convert Bitcoin and several altcoins, including Ether, Bitshares, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin and more into Steem or Steem Dollars and have it sent to the Steem account of your choosing. \n\nAs per the screenshot below, you can select the Bitcoin and SBD pair, populate the SBD field with 3 SBD (or multiples of 3), the receive address with **steemvoter** and **your Steem account name** in the memo field. As easy as that!\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmekF5Z3M9xGa7qiicyAS1ARRuX81DkU7aur6H7mdvGbxF/image.png)\n\n-------------------\n\n## Should you require any assistance with our service please contact  @cryptomancer, our tech support guru, in the [#steemvoter-support channel of MinnowBooster Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/3aCpRHF).\n\n-----------------------\n\n## A witness vote for our co-owner @thecryptodrive would be much appreciated if you can spare it.
