But focus for how long they never say it. Our human brain gets distracted very easily and being in focus requires a hell lot of effort if you want to achieve something. \n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/aoxzfexqko.jpg)\n\nFor example if you want to understand a math problem you need to keep your focus till the time that problem is solved but what about the next problem. Should you keep the same focus or you need to start all over again.\n\nWhat have I learn is to keep focus until you can. If even being in focus nothing is going in your way then you need to give yourself a break and start all over again when your mind is fully rested. So many times it happens with me that I could not solve a bug in my code but when I start looking it again with the same intensity and focus the next day some or the other solutions start working.\n\nSo what we call a distraction is not actually a distraction is a way of you mind to say you that give the mind some rest to start focusing again. This also should be taught to you in every phase of life just like everyone taught you to keep focusing.\n\nWe all know life is not easy that means being in focus everyday will not get you the desired result then what should you do. This is were the mentor comes in picture who can help you to come out of that situation. That mentor can be your friend, teacher parents or even your colleague whom you never talk with.","created":"July 12, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Focus for a little longer","permlink":"focus-for-a-little-longer-78e9e8e02afeb","previous":{"title":"Are you afraid of coming out of Comfort Zone?","permlink":"are-you-afraid-of-coming-out-of-comfort-zone-8873ab06f8d2a"},"next":{"title":"Uploading Image from Angular to ASP.NET Core Web API","permlink":"uploading-image-from-angular-to-asp-net-core-web-api"}}}}
