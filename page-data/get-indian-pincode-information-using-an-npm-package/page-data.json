If it is by pincode it will give you all the details about the pincode whereas if it is by the area it will give the details about the area as well as the pincode of that area.\n\n### Search by Pincode\n\n```\nvar pin = require('pincode');\npin.seachByPin('560038', function (response){\n    response.forEach(function (data) {\n        console.log(data);\n    });\n});\n```\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1512904758/l8tkiwrti2vekrasced4.png)\n\nAs shown above when searched by the pincode it gave the details like teh Taluk Name, Office Name etc.\n\n### Search by Area\n\n```\npin.seachByArea('Bangalore', function (response) {\n    response.forEach(function (data) {\n        console.log(data);\n    });\n});\n```\n\n![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1512905187/am2mejmatmwq0spjsa1b.png)\n\nIt was actually created just for my use, so that I can get the info of any Indian Pincode at any point of time.\n\n\n\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/get-indian-pincode-information-using-an-npm-package\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"December 10, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Get Indian PinCode Information using an NPM package","permlink":"get-indian-pincode-information-using-an-npm-package","previous":{"title":"On the Way to Temple near Nandi Hills","permlink":"on-the-way-to-temple-near-nandi-hills"},"next":{"title":"Crypto Price Checker NPM Module","permlink":"crypto-price-checker-npm-module"}}}}
