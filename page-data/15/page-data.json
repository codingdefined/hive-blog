Is it so hard to say these sentences now-a-days I did wrong or I made a mistake? Why today being perfect is so important where no one wants to accept their mistakes. \n\nOne thing people do not understand that if you are not admitting the mistake you are increasing the stress in your life which is really bad for the healthy life. Since everyone is on social media now-a-days they are showing their perfect vacation, perfect home, perfect everything to the whole world even though the reality might not be the same, which is also making you stressed out. \n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmSuK3FTV4PNYvGLkcjfHtBASTRDcQ33ZTqNQrWtmzQGY2/image.png)\nPC : https://www.flickr.com/photos/quoteseverlasting/8640869656\n\nWhen you realize that its OK to make a mistake, it will give you the strength to rectify that mistake. Otherwise, you will try to find ways to find out the middle way to run from your mistake which will eventually create a problem for you. It's on your hand if you want to stress out from your mistake or rectify it to live a better life.\n\nEveryone does mistakes, mistakes are part of life. But the best part of it is that it gives you tons of lessons on the life which will eventually make you a better person or you grow as a person. The beauty of mistakes is that it teaches you something or the other and these are the best teachers in your life. Though one will argue that what will happen to that person who does the same mistake again and again, does he not learning. Those people are leaning too, might be slow. \n\nRectifying your mistakes might take time, but you should not worry, just that you have to analyze it and fix with the best of your capability. You can take help from your family members or friends too because they can help you to improve your thought process and thus make you the better person after all.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"life\",\"discussion\",\"thoughts\",\"blog\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmSuK3FTV4PNYvGLkcjfHtBASTRDcQ33ZTqNQrWtmzQGY2\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/quoteseverlasting\\/8640869656\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"a6509a74-ece1-54c8-937a-1be7c0003c8b","title":"Sunset in Ramnagaram","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 20, 2018","permlink":"sunset-in-ramnagaram","body":"This photo was taken above the hill in Ramnagaram.\n\n![IMG_20180908_172432-01.jpeg](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmU7UcjFV3GPRngai7sMq6ucU22XFHSmStL4TFc755AVDE)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6\n","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"goldenhourphotography\",\"india\",\"busy\",\"sunset\",\"photography\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/ipfs.busy.org\\/ipfs\\/QmU7UcjFV3GPRngai7sMq6ucU22XFHSmStL4TFc755AVDE\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"a85bdc48-02d6-5365-b28d-7dc5f2999dc6","title":"A beautiful Sunset","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 17, 2018","permlink":"a-beautiful-sunset-1d99ce4ca3c06","body":"You get a lot of time being in hospital, I too got some time to click some photos.\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/vqbsr2zapb.jpg)\n\n ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/xmephwuuad.jpg)\n\nCamera : Nokia 6","json_metadata":"{\"links\":[],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/vqbsr2zapb.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/img.esteem.ws\\/xmephwuuad.jpg\"],\"tags\":[\"goldenhourphotography\",\"photography\",\"photo\",\"india\",\"photofeed\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"6ce9ba52-c69f-5afd-84a1-d7b9561ac2ad","title":"Happy Ganesh Chaturthi","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 15, 2018","permlink":"happy-ganesh-chaturthi-02449c8fd4433","body":"In India 2 days back we have celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi, as I was busy I could not post about it.\n\nGanesh Chaturthi which is also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi is our festival where we celebrate the birth of Lord Ganesha.

Its automatically generated from the specification, which makes it really easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.\n\nI have created a LetsDisc which will be a Clone of StackOverflow on Steem Blockchain. LetsDisc can solve the problem to keep everything on one place. Though you will have an option to Post on Steem, if you do not have the Steem Account, you can use it without posting it. As of now you can Login, Register, Create/Edit Question, Upvote other users questions.\n\nI tried to change the normal JavaScript code to AngularJS, so for that I try to use SwaggerUI for consuming in my frontend. To do it I have done like below,\n\nAt first Install the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package(https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/) to your Web project.\n\nThen added the below code in ConfigureServices function of Startup.cs\n\n```\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(options =>\n{\n options.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new Info{Title=\"LetsDisc API\",Version=\"v1\"});\n options.DocInclusionPredicate((docName, description) => true);\n});\n```\n\nThen added the below code in Configure function of Startup.cs\n\n```\n// Enable middleware to serve generated Swagger as a JSON endpoint\napp.UseSwagger();\n// Enable middleware to serve swagger-ui assets (HTML, JS, CSS etc.)\napp.UseSwaggerUI(options =>\n{\n  options.SwaggerEndpoint(_appConfiguration[\"App:ServerRootAddress\"] \n     + \"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\", \"LetsDisc API V1\");\n  options.IndexStream = () => Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()\n    .GetManifestResourceStream\n       (\"LetsDisc.Web.Host.wwwroot.swagger.ui.index.html\");\n}); // URL: /swagger\n```\n\nThat's it, when you run your application and go to /swagger/index.html you will see all the API's are documented.\n\n![swagger.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUvb3mL517ncH6Z4CyvjdCHhi6NwCJgmFec1vMtJqewR2/swagger.png)\n\nAlso Posted : http://www.codingdefined.com/2018/09/how-i-added-swagger-in-letsdisc-repo.html","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"steemdevs\",\"development\",\"programming\",\"letsdisc\",\"busy\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.nuget.org\\/packages\\/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\\/\",\"http:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2018\\/09\\/how-i-added-swagger-in-letsdisc-repo.html\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmUvb3mL517ncH6Z4CyvjdCHhi6NwCJgmFec1vMtJqewR2\\/swagger.png\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"a908fb5f-8b18-56eb-a3e6-610e66a8ed0b","title":"Do you often provide Constructive Criticism?","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 12, 2018","permlink":"do-you-often-provide-constructive-criticism-579e814d0eb0e","body":"Once in your lifetime you might have to provide feedback for others work, how do you do that. Do you just bring out negative and ask the person to change it, or you just point out the positive and leave the negative. Or do you point out both equally.\n\nThough pointing out both is good, as you need to bring out best from that person and you want him to improve. This is where Constructive Criticism can play its role where you have a set of instructions that aims to improve the overall quality by bringing out the negative aspect without upsetting the other person. Constrictive Criticism often contains helpful and specific suggestions for positive change you would like to see rather than providing the general feedback what is good and what is bad.\n\nOne way of writing constructive criticism comments is making a sandwich of positive improvement and then again positive. In that way you are pointing out the positive along with some improvement which will not make the person receiving feedback upset.\n\nYou also need to provide recommendations on how to improve.

Then there is a famous line for you that\n\n>The best time to invest was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.\n\nThat is you should not think of past but start at the very moment i.e. now.
