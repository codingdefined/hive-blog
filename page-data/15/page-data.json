Its automatically generated from the specification, which makes it really easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.\n\nI have created a LetsDisc which will be a Clone of StackOverflow on Steem Blockchain. LetsDisc can solve the problem to keep everything on one place. Though you will have an option to Post on Steem, if you do not have the Steem Account, you can use it without posting it. As of now you can Login, Register, Create/Edit Question, Upvote other users questions.\n\nI tried to change the normal JavaScript code to AngularJS, so for that I try to use SwaggerUI for consuming in my frontend. To do it I have done like below,\n\nAt first Install the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package(https://www.nuget.org/packages/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/) to your Web project.\n\nThen added the below code in ConfigureServices function of Startup.cs\n\n```\nservices.AddSwaggerGen(options =>\n{\n options.SwaggerDoc(\"v1\", new Info{Title=\"LetsDisc API\",Version=\"v1\"});\n options.DocInclusionPredicate((docName, description) => true);\n});\n```\n\nThen added the below code in Configure function of Startup.cs\n\n```\n// Enable middleware to serve generated Swagger as a JSON endpoint\napp.UseSwagger();\n// Enable middleware to serve swagger-ui assets (HTML, JS, CSS etc.)\napp.UseSwaggerUI(options =>\n{\n  options.SwaggerEndpoint(_appConfiguration[\"App:ServerRootAddress\"] \n     + \"/swagger/v1/swagger.json\", \"LetsDisc API V1\");\n  options.IndexStream = () => Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()\n    .GetManifestResourceStream\n       (\"LetsDisc.Web.Host.wwwroot.swagger.ui.index.html\");\n}); // URL: /swagger\n```\n\nThat's it, when you run your application and go to /swagger/index.html you will see all the API's are documented.\n\n![swagger.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUvb3mL517ncH6Z4CyvjdCHhi6NwCJgmFec1vMtJqewR2/swagger.png)\n\nAlso Posted : http://www.codingdefined.com/2018/09/how-i-added-swagger-in-letsdisc-repo.html","json_metadata":"{\"community\":\"busy\",\"app\":\"busy\\/2.5.6\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"tags\":[\"steemdevs\",\"development\",\"programming\",\"letsdisc\",\"busy\"],\"users\":[],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/www.nuget.org\\/packages\\/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\\/\",\"http:\\/\\/www.codingdefined.com\\/2018\\/09\\/how-i-added-swagger-in-letsdisc-repo.html\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/cdn.steemitimages.com\\/DQmUvb3mL517ncH6Z4CyvjdCHhi6NwCJgmFec1vMtJqewR2\\/swagger.png\"]}"}},{"node":{"id":"a908fb5f-8b18-56eb-a3e6-610e66a8ed0b","title":"Do you often provide Constructive Criticism?","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 12, 2018","permlink":"do-you-often-provide-constructive-criticism-579e814d0eb0e","body":"Once in your lifetime you might have to provide feedback for others work, how do you do that. Do you just bring out negative and ask the person to change it, or you just point out the positive and leave the negative. Or do you point out both equally.\n\nThough pointing out both is good, as you need to bring out best from that person and you want him to improve. This is where Constructive Criticism can play its role where you have a set of instructions that aims to improve the overall quality by bringing out the negative aspect without upsetting the other person. Constrictive Criticism often contains helpful and specific suggestions for positive change you would like to see rather than providing the general feedback what is good and what is bad.\n\nOne way of writing constructive criticism comments is making a sandwich of positive improvement and then again positive. In that way you are pointing out the positive along with some improvement which will not make the person receiving feedback upset.\n\nYou also need to provide recommendations on how to improve. Now recommendations are personal preference, it doesn't applies always but it's good to give.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"writing\",\"feedback\",\"india\",\"blog\",\"life\"],\"app\":\"esteem\\/1.6.0\",\"format\":\"markdown+html\",\"community\":\"esteem\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"527cb6a2-9567-5db3-b633-3f462198d732","title":"Do you Invest your Fiat Money?","author":"codingdefined","created":"September 10, 2018","permlink":"do-you-invest-your-fiat-money","body":"I came across a very interesting article on Howmuch.net, that what if you have invested $1000 dollars in various stock 10 years ago.

Have you ever considered that if you would have invested 10 years ago, you might be getting an exceptional return of your investment?\n\nThe stock market is very risky just like Cryptocurrency market, so have you found an alternative method. How about Investing in Recurring Deposit where you invest $10 every month to a bank to get a fixed return or investing in a mutual fund. \n\nYou might be thinking, I have not started earning 10 years ago so what should I do now. Then there is a famous line for you that\n\n>The best time to invest was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.\n\nThat is you should not think of past but start at the very moment i.e. now.

On any visit due to time constraint, you might not be able to travel to all the places, so I would like to travel to that place again so that I will visit the previously missed places. \n\n2.
