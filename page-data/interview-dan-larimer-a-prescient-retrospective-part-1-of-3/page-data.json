Dan Larimer answered all our questions with only a cursory awareness of what we were about to ask him.  I hope you all enjoy the video and hopefully, the interview will spark some interesting discussion here.\n\nBest wishes,\n@lovejoy\n\n--------------------\n\n## Watch Part 2 Here:\n[Dan Larimer - A Prescient Retrospective - Part 2 of 3](https://steemit.com/interview/@lovejoy/interview-dan-larimer-a-prescient-retrospective-part-2-of-3)\n\n----------------------\n\nhttps://s20.postimg.org/txr1230a5/brando-santacruz3.jpg","created":"July 09, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"[Interview] Dan Larimer - A Prescient Retrospective - Part 1 of 3","permlink":"interview-dan-larimer-a-prescient-retrospective-part-1-of-3","previous":{"title":"Miss.
