The initial goal of Steemit, which was to reward quality content was defeated in the sense that, creators of absolutely great content weren't recognized, and really cool talents were ignored. This major problem was the bane that stirred up the idea, creation, and finally, the development of Knacksteem. Talents and skills would never go unrecognized and unrewarded. The organization of Knacksteem makes this possible.\n\nSource: https://steemit.com/knacksteem/@harry-heightz/knacksteem-the-new-den-of-talents-on-steem-blockchaingeneral-overview-and-personal-opinions-ideas-id-7dya4bjgagg\n\n### New Features - Downvoting and Un-Voting of Post\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmUxT1HvfV8hUuZiBsnt9YxRNvKdbeDH9Gj3pthKQAox2k/image.png)\n\nUpvoting was already added. In this contribution, I have added Downvoting and Unvoting feature. One of the main thing added is to get information about the votes of the post, be it positive or negative. Based on that we show the count of the upvote.\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPmRf2Nkxx4uUmNC4vkCbEqjM5o7gjPkrv88ranVBAYeT/image.png)\n\n### New Features - Adding Guidelines\n\nAdded the guidelines of KnackSteem\n\n![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmegdyN3swzvK17cD9uSiY8zjFsMFx1r9KLkowTcwQPRP7/image.png)\n\n### Bug Fixes - Fixing Search Functionality\n\nSearch was not working Because we were using USERLIST_GET_SEARCH and ARTICLES_GET_SEARCH but that was removed somehow, so instead of creating again, used the existing one.\n\n### GitHub Account\nhttps://github.com/codingdefined","created":"January 29, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Downvoting, Upvoting, Guidelines Added to KnackSteem","permlink":"downvoting-upvoting-guidelines-added-to-knacksteem","previous":{"title":"A Cheat Day on the day of Republic Day","permlink":"a-cheat-day-on-the-day-of-republic-day-8b245e0217288"},"next":{"title":"Voting Slider and Scoring Slider Added to KnackSteem","permlink":"voting-slider-and-scoring-slider-added-to-knacksteem"}}}}
