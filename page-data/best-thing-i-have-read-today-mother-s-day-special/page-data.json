I could have never ever dreamt of such a life for my child..\"\n\nAnd he broke down almost trembling:\n\n\"Hold on, you assume a lot...we allowed your daughter because she is very bright and you have been our sincere worker.. Let me call a teacher in, she will read it out and translate it to you... this is written by your daughter and I want you to read this.\"\n\nSoon enough the teacher was called and she started reading it, translating each line in Hindi...\n\nIt read-\n\n\"Today we are asked to write about Mother's Day.\n\nI belong to a village in Bihar, a tiny village where medical and education still seem like a far fetched dream. Many women die every now and then while giving birth. My mother was one of them too, she could not even hold me in her arms. My father was the first person to hold me.. or perhaps the only person.\n\nEveryone was sad.. as I was a girl and I had \"eaten up\" my own mother.\n\nMy dad was instantly asked to remarry but he refused.\n\nMy grandparents forced him by giving all logical, illogical and emotional reasons but he didn't budge.\n\nMy grand parents wanted a grandson, they threatened him to remarry or else he will be disowned...\n\nHe didn't think twice... he left everything, his acres of land.. a good living, comfortable house, cattles and everything that counts for a good lifestyle in a village.\n\nHe came to this huge city with absolutely nothing -- but me in his arms. Life was tough, he worked hard day and night.. raised me with tender love and utmost care.\n\nNow I understand why suddenly he developed a dislike for things that I would love to eat when there was only one piece left in the platter.... he would say that he hates eating it and I would finish it considering that he does not like it.... but as I grew older I realised the reason and what sacrifice is all about.\n\nHe gave me the best possible comforts beyond his capacity.\n\nThis school gave him a shelter, respect and the biggest gift -- an admission to his daughter...\n\nIf love and care defines a mother... then my father fits in there.\n\nIf compassion defines a mother, my father fits in well in that category too...\n\nIf sacrifice defines a mother, my father dominates that category.\n\nSo in nut shell.. if a mother is made of love, care sacrifice and compassion...\n\nMY FATHER IS THE BEST MOTHER ON EARTH THEN.\n\nOn Mother's Day, I would like to wish my father for being the best parent on earth... I salute him and say it with pride that the hardworking gardener working in this school is my father.\n\nI know I may fail this test after my teacher reads this -- but this would be a very small price one would pay towards an ode to the selfless love of my father.\n\nThere was a deafening silence in the room... one could only hear soft sobbing of Ganga Das....\n\nThe harsh sun could not wet his clothes with sweat but soft words of his daughter had soaked his chest with tears.... he was standing there with hands folded..\n\nHe took the paper from teacher's hands... held it close to his heart and sobbed.\n\nPrincipal got up.. offered him a chair, glass of water and said something... but, strangely the crispness of her voice was taken over by a surprising warmth and sweetness....\n\n\"Ganga Das.. your daughter is given 10/10 marks for this essay... This is the best essay ever written about Mother's Day in the history of this school. We are having the Mother's Day gala event tomorrow and the entire School Management has decided to invite you as the Chief Guest for the event...\n\nThis is to honour all the love and sacrifice a man can do to raise his children... to show that you do not have to be a woman to be the perfect parent...\n\nAnd most importantly this is to reinforce/appreciate/acknowledge the strong belief of your daughter in you, to make her feel proud.. to make the entire school feel proud that we have the best parent on earth as stated by your daughter.\"\n\n\"You are a True Gardner, who is not only looking after the gardens, but also nurturing the most precious flower of your life in such a beautiful way....\"\n\n\"So Ganga Das, will you be our Chief Guest for the event?”","created":"July 13, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Best Thing I have Read Today - Mother's Day Special","permlink":"best-thing-i-have-read-today-mother-s-day-special","previous":{"title":"decentralized video hosting","permlink":"decentralized-video-hosting"},"next":{"title":"Past and Present","permlink":"past-and-present"}}}}
