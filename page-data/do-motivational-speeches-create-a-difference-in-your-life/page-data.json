So my question to all of you guys that do Motivational articles or Speeches create a difference in your life or it is just for the sake of reading articles you read it and then forget it all together.\n#\n\nA termed Motivation in its simple form means \"to move on\" means whatever situation you are in, you have to move out from that situation as soon as possible to feel higher. But how you are gonna move out? Do Motivational Speeches talk about that?\n\nAll the motivational speeches out there revolve about generating inspirations from someone's life and then asked you do the same, does everyone's life the same? Can everyone do the same task to succeed or to move on from his desperation as discussed in the motivational speech?\n\nWhenever you hear any motivational speech the speaker mainly talked about his own experience or similar incident where someone has overcome it very brilliantly or quote some famous quotes on motivation. That can motivate the audience but does it actually encourage the audience to succeed in its path until and unless he works on that.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSxJkZD9iwS7gGbyTAWc7b8w7UjZdRy96HmWhkcvxrKuK/image.png)\nPC : https://www.daniel-one.com/2016/11/06/inspiration-motivational-speeches/\n\nI am not denying the fact that Motivational Speeches are good because it moved so many people around the globe to move on and work through all the difficulties they are facing but does only motivational speeches helped them or do they have to start working on it to make it good.</center>\n\n\n### What are your Thoughts on this?","created":"April 18, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Do Motivational Speeches Create A Difference in Your Life?","permlink":"do-motivational-speeches-create-a-difference-in-your-life","previous":{"title":"Sunset in Bangalore, India","permlink":"sunset-in-bangalore-india"},"next":{"title":"GoldenHourPhotography - A ray of Hope","permlink":"goldenhourphotography-a-ray-of-hope"}}}}
