Then, we also have to take taxes into account (big chunk of money), which further dilute your income.\n\nMost people work 8 hours per day and travel. So, how do you make money the other 16 hours? Simple. You need to create assets that generate income around the clock. There is nothing wrong with having a job to pay the bills and buy necessities, but a job rarely sets you up for financial independence. You need assets that pay you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year in this new sharing economy.\n\nAnd that asset is your Blog.

Today, I boarded into a BMTC bus to go to my office in the morning. It was very much crowded. The bus fare was 19 rupees. I gave 20 rupees to the bus conductor and asked for a ticket. He gave me the ticket to my office (for 19 rupees). He did not give the remaining one rupee.\n\nI asked him to give the one rupee and he told that he was not having 1 rupee change and he will give it to me when I am getting down.\n\n3 other passengers were also travelling to my office. They also gave 20 rupees for a ticket and the conductor did not pay the remaining 1 rupees to each of them. I was observing this.\n\nUsually, when the bus reaches my office, nearly 30 or 40 passengers (all are IT employees) will get down and conductor can/will not give the change at that bus stop. He will keep that with himself (as a commission!!) That is why he will never give us the change at the time of giving a ticket even though he has it !!\n\nSo, now let's come to the story. The bus was approaching my office and I asked the conductor a change of one rupee. He told that he did not have the change. And the bus had reached my office.\n\nThen an old lady boarded into the bus. While seeing her, I understood that she is poor and helpless. So, what I did was I yelled in the bus, ‚ÄúHi all, how many of you need the 1 rupee change (remaining) from the conductor? Please raise your hands‚Äù. Approximately 20 hands were raised.\n\nSo I asked them, ‚ÄúFriends are you ready to give this one rupee to this Grandma for her bus ticket?‚Äù\n\nEvery body said. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù . So, I asked the conductor to give her a ticket with that 20 rupees. He stared at me and gave the ticket to that Granny.\n\nEverybody started smiling(except the conductor) and the smile from that Granny made me to smile with Pride !!\n\n( Stop giving Bribes/commissions and Start helping the needy !!)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"inspiration\",\"life\",\"story\",\"love\",\"motivation\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"8f383ebb-e038-51eb-bac4-12891d14c343","title":"Travel to Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, India","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 11, 2017","permlink":"travel-to-ranganathittu-bird-sanctuary-india","body":"Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary is situated in the Mandya District, Karnataka in India.\n\n![WP_20141102_14_02_07_Pro.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRXZ78PBAbbNa72TZVUTfRYcnWyciMshCPqiLY2KVuoEv/WP_20141102_14_02_07_Pro.jpg)\n\n![WP_20141102_14_51_24_Pro.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaazevTZY5Vvup8FzQLpP1EjSjvS4R5HfwYirXLJBc74o/WP_20141102_14_51_24_Pro.jpg)\n\n![WP_20141102_15_25_39_Pro.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQuZFEoHzE34T9HAQRJ3tjaoiEoMSdXT53KnoXfkt94Z3/WP_20141102_15_25_39_Pro.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"travel\",\"india\",\"photography\",\"nature\",\"photo\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRXZ78PBAbbNa72TZVUTfRYcnWyciMshCPqiLY2KVuoEv\\/WP_20141102_14_02_07_Pro.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaazevTZY5Vvup8FzQLpP1EjSjvS4R5HfwYirXLJBc74o\\/WP_20141102_14_51_24_Pro.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQuZFEoHzE34T9HAQRJ3tjaoiEoMSdXT53KnoXfkt94Z3\\/WP_20141102_15_25_39_Pro.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"7098a6f4-3041-5932-9e97-d68d25446f88","title":"Steemit Colour Challenge - Thursday Green","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 10, 2017","permlink":"steemit-colour-challenge-thursday-green","body":"**An Old House with greenery around it.**\n\n![_DSC0007.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcsWGjZnWACnzAjnaQXYU8QWvvDZz7EvsMeQcnJLQNiAn/_DSC0007.jpg)\n\n**A lone house on the mountain**\n\n ![_DSC0019.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmanzxfmDDiLFZSqdqtcVXku8krsgaL6W95ZtVPsnghP7o/_DSC0019.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemitphotochallenge\",\"colorchallenge\",\"india\",\"photo\",\"photography\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmcsWGjZnWACnzAjnaQXYU8QWvvDZz7EvsMeQcnJLQNiAn\\/_DSC0007.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmanzxfmDDiLFZSqdqtcVXku8krsgaL6W95ZtVPsnghP7o\\/_DSC0019.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"95a57613-d226-5e8a-b401-8dc4e11dc823","title":"Lord Shiva - Spiritual Day Out","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 09, 2017","permlink":"lord-shiva-spiritual-day-out","body":"Largest Statue of Lord Shiva in Bangalore\n\n![20170730_175348.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTbt92J6QYf6Sz165GKoM3L7GV5cVmV5VEbcTXYqoYnww/20170730_175348.jpg)","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemitphotochallenge\",\"colorchallenge\",\"india\",\"photo\",\"photography\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmTbt92J6QYf6Sz165GKoM3L7GV5cVmV5VEbcTXYqoYnww\\/20170730_175348.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"aa6c8a59-fdd4-5171-9071-391d063f5b9f","title":"üí∞ Giveaway: I will give $5 Steem Dollars just for Upvoting & Resteeming üí∞","author":"saini11","created":"August 09, 2017","permlink":"giveaway-i-will-give-usd5-steem-dollars-just-for-upvoting-and-resteeming","body":"This time i will give away $5.00 Steem Dollars to 100 people.
