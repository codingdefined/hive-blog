What you think","body":"![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmNrANWse4g3CtCT838ztXaETxUGefc6wx6b5HxU4WcXwt/image.png)\n\nPicture Courtesy : https://postalmuseum.si.edu/indiansatthepostoffice/mural9.html\n\nIt came to notice when by the Motherboards magazine and its breaking the internet ever since. You can read the whole thing out here https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3db9b/iphone-man-1937-painting\n\nThe few lines from the article is \n\n>Lower right quadrant. Seated. Holding a small, black, rectangular object at about eye level.\n\n>See him?\n\n>It's not clear exactly who this man is, but he might as well be popping off a selfie or thumbing through his news feed. He seems to gaze into the handheld device in such a way that renders all-too-familiar today, as if he's just read a bad tweet or recoiling from a Trump-related push notification from the Times. He would almost look unremarkable, if only he and the world around him existed at any point in the past decade.\n\nSo I would like to know from my fellow steemians that do you believe there exists a time travel where someone from the future dropped his smartphone in the 19th century.  \n\nIf not the time travel, what you think is he holding by seeing his expression. Is it a mirror.","created":"August 28, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"In 80 year old painting it looks like someone is holding a Smart Phone?
