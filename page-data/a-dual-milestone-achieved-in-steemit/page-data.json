Its not that it is a big achievement but its something to be documented. \n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUUGNJ7vLsBFq6jYzJ54YmrqtQY1vkQCbLiqEPXUgWm6H/image.png)\n\nI am here for 3.5 months and I know that in terms of rewards I am not gaining a lot, but I can proudly said that I have made few good friends out here and I guess that is what more important to build a community rather than just the rewards. \n\nI am also working on some of the coding projects which will help integrating Discord App more with Steemit, and would like to contribute more for this awesome community.\n\nThanks All\n\n<hr>\n\n## <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","created":"October 18, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"A Dual Milestone Achieved in Steemit","permlink":"a-dual-milestone-achieved-in-steemit","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Tuesday Orange - An Orange Flower","permlink":"colorchallenge-tuesday-orange-an-orange-flower"},"next":{"title":"Indians are gearing up for Diwali Festival","permlink":"indians-are-gearing-up-for-diwali-festival"}}}}
