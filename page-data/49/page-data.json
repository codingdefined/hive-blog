However, these ‚Äûnews‚Äù cannot be considered as official and reliable information, but many times we have learnt critical information from the internet press.\n\nThe events captured by them are : Seismically activities, Tsunami events, Nuclear power plant status (only USA), Wild animals in danger of biological (only USA), Severe weather events (hailstorm, tornadoes and dangerous winds) in USA, Forest fire events (mostly in US) and Geomagnetic Storm Alert. \n\nThey do have operators all around the world which give information about the events like Acid rain, Cold wave, Fires, Floods, Storm, Tsunami and tidal wave etc.\n\nNow if I talk about India as of 12th Sep, 11:00 AM IST, I can see that there was a Vehicle Accident happened yesterday.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZFhKRWvmbrn5caAap1vM1jbtUUEPFsEFi2eEj3Pwo3o2/image.png)\n\nThe event report is spontaneous, as you can see there was a Biological Hazard in Ontario, Canada just when I was writing this post.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeVvUc79ZgPE6BgMsymKXfRvErSaJ1tsnuAwpdtYrGuHh/image.png)\n\nThe whole world map looks like below where you can see any place affected at that time.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZPiEqNBnWBYd9gZkA2NfCcb2UyQaozTvwW3SGwAB52M1/image.png)\n\nThe website is http://hisz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/index2.php.
