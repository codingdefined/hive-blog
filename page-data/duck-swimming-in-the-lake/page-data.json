Unlike Humans Duck mind their own business at least while swimming which I observe and do not poke nose in any one's matter even though their nose is bigger than us. \n\nThere was no editing done in any of the pictures. As you can see the first picture was shot on ISO 100 and it gave me somewhat less light. Thus increasing the ISO helped in the low light scenario. This is one of the disadvantages of having the basic lens because usually, I prefer to shoot in ISO 100 only.\n\n![IMG_0878.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNt9fyvoecgrhku3eHXfsg96aML91c6WZ4TmjdAmaR7ga/IMG_0878.jpg)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/5.6\nExposure | 1/80\nISO | 100\n\n----\n\n![IMG_0881.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYRKwJvrCYR7ktPjF2NyaReEtFCCkvQqE1bgz1JN7Sge9/IMG_0881.jpg)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/5.6\nExposure | 1/80\nISO | 200\n\n----\n\n![IMG_0883.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmPz3uTuU2QjCK3PBnefN1Sfr9z1fBkRJVEmMhWzhVXr6G/IMG_0883.jpg)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/5.6\nExposure | 1/80\nISO | 200\n\n----\n\n![IMG_0885.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNnacjjxWc8ejXEoyyEjFabQDX8CviNpEMpUQDgatSorB/IMG_0885.jpg)\n\nCamera | Canon 200 D\n--- | ---\nLens |  EF-S 18-55mm\nAperture | F/5.6\nExposure | 1/80\nISO | 200\n\n----\n\nDo let me know, which one you liked the most :)","created":"August 29, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Duck Swimming in the Lake","permlink":"duck-swimming-in-the-lake","previous":{"title":"My entry for the #monomad challenge : Collection","permlink":"my-entry-for-the-monomad-challenge-collection"},"next":{"title":"Why I am investing more in Debt than Equity","permlink":"why-i-am-investing-more-in-debt-than-equity"}}}}
