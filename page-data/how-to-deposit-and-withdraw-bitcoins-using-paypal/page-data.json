I came accross a site called Virwox which allows you to do the conversion between the Paypal money and the Bitcoin.\n\nUsing [Virwox]() is not as simple as it looks. At first, you need to Buy SLL (Second Life Linden Dollars) using your currency through the SLL/USD exchange. Now when you have the SLL you can buy Bitcoin using the SLL/BTC exchange.  \n\nThe only disadvantage which I feel using this system is the High Fees. Just look at the fees below. So If I want to convert from USD to Bitcoin 100 SLL is the fixed fees (two exchange USD/SLL and SLL/BTC) and then the variable fees.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmXkEYqKZsNgcUVt7ou9mdX2N2qCh2igqSaqSD1QWM8qyE/image.png)\n\nPC : Virwox.com\n\nBut wait not only that, there is a fees on withdrawal also which is 0.001BTC per BTC (A handling fee of 0.001 BTC per bitcoin withdrawal will be charged).\n\nThe advantage of using it is the Security. They are one of the most secure websites out there. Even if the advantage is very less as compared to the disadvantage but I feel there is a way by which I can send the money over to Bitcoin Wallet using the Paypal.\n\nHave you tried Virwox, if yes please share the experience with us.","created":"October 17, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"How to Deposit and Withdraw Bitcoins using Paypal","permlink":"how-to-deposit-and-withdraw-bitcoins-using-paypal","previous":{"title":"Life of a Software Engineer","permlink":"life-of-a-software-engineer"},"next":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Tuesday Orange - An Orange Flower","permlink":"colorchallenge-tuesday-orange-an-orange-flower"}}}}
