I am a very conservative investor where I only invest in schemes that are moderately risky that is more into debt and less into equity. \n\nAfter a year of investing in various schemes, I settled on 4 funds which I feel is more than enough for my needs and thus created a Portfolio in Groww.in so that more and more people can watch the portfolio and invest if they feel that their Goal is aligned with mine. \n\nThe funds which I am investing in are :\n\n1. Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund\n2. Reliance Small Cap Fund\n3. Aditya Birla Sun Life MNC Fund\n4. ICICI Prudential Liquid Fund\n\nThe amount invested per month as follows :\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYjHZEEas9Z2Cnk5m3cF9bYd7dyQt5mSrPsYCTm2mFAjW)\n\nAs you can see I am investing around Rs 2778 or 40$ per month. Though it's not limited to SIP, I sometimes invest lumpsum also. When I checked my portfolio today, I am sitting on a profit which is around 10% in the last one year, which is not bad at all because I know even if it goes down I will always be in a profit since the risk is not too high.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmT1de2RYPoFU7JS2a1R5eiobPUXBCfWw7JQhzj7WrWvk5)\n\nAlso, the length of my portfolio is Ultra Short Duration which means it will always give me profit in a short duration no matter what, thus I will always have my money in hand if I need it. \n\nSo anyone investing in  this less risk portfolio for 5 years, with Rs. 20000, they will easily get more than 15.5 Lakhs.\n\n![image.png](https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTuhiVe88rBvX8qJF15LqwkuB3D8Qe6bMddPxbALZKfar)","created":"November 05, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Created a Less risky and Moderate Profit Mutual Fund Portfolio","permlink":"created-a-less-risky-and-moderate-profit-mutual-fund-portfolio","previous":{"title":"A Simple bug turns out to be a Night Mare","permlink":"a-simple-bug-turns-out-to-be-a-night-mare"},"next":{"title":"A tiring festive season","permlink":"a-tiring-festive-season"}}}}
