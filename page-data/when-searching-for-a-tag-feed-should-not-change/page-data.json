So even if you search for any tag, feed should be as it is.\n\nFor Example, my feed looks like below where I can see all the posts from my followers \n\n![Screenshot_20171218-173207.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513598872/fipj5ezqhveoldkx36uq.png)\n\nNow lets say I serached for any tag (utopian-io), it will take you to all the new contributions of Utopian-io as shown below \n\n![Screenshot_20171218-173234.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513599004/chzbb30uvmcaxffyyifa.png)\n\nBut when I again go to Feed it should show me the posts from my followers and not change the Feed to Feed utopian-io. \n\n![Screenshot_20171218-173327.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513599068/egktwdtwf2hqnf5myy2g.png)\n\nThe above posts shows me the posts as Feed Utopian-io but it does not contain the tag utopian.io\n\n![Screenshot_20171218-173345.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513599140/llb631fr7glpoh56ucil.png)\n\nSo my suggestion would be when I come to my feed, it should show only Feed and not Feed Utopian-io, as its making confusion to the user.\n\n<br /><hr/><em>Posted on <a href=\"https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@codingdefined/when-searching-for-a-tag-feed-should-not-change\">Utopian.io -  Rewarding Open Source Contributors</a></em><hr/>","created":"December 18, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"When Searching for a Tag, Feed should not change","permlink":"when-searching-for-a-tag-feed-should-not-change","previous":{"title":"A Water Glass Bottle","permlink":"a-water-glass-bottle"},"next":{"title":"Color Challenge - Monday Red - Red Flowers","permlink":"color-challenge-monday-red-red-flowers"}}}}
