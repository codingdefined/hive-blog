He indicated to us that his mom made many sacrifices for him and loves him very much, in return he promoted and uplifted her on Steem. This is the kind of good that comes out of collaborative ventures such as Steemvoter Guilds and makes what we do mean something. Thank you for solidifying our purpose @indian-mom and Good Son. \n\n\n## Previous runner-up - [Tutorial Drawing Hanzo from Overwatch Game](https://steemit.com/art/@ferdian/tutorial-drowing-hanzo-from-overwatch-game) by @ferdian\n\n<br>\n\nNow on to today's nominations...\n\n## The \"Nominate-a-Friend\" Steemvoter (SV) Guild program. \n\nSo how does it work? Simple ... reply with a comment to this post with the link to another Steemian's post you think deserves the daily Steemvoter guild upvote, you are welcome to motivate in the reply why you think they deserve it. \n\nThe reply with the highest upvote $ value will be the winner and the post nominated in that reply will receive the guild upvote, which as you may have seen from previous posts, is a generous upvote from over 500 guild members, giving $100 dollars or more to the author depending on starting value.\n\nPlease make sure your nomination follows these guidelines:\n\n## Two  Winner Trial Test\n\nWe are currently voting the top two winning nominations at an equal vote weight each. \n\n## Basic Guidelines\n\n+ **You cannot submit your own post or that of your other related accounts that you own or share ownership in**, if you are found or reported to do this and substantially verified, your and your related accounts will be blacklisted from future guild vote eligibility. \n\n+ No religious, NSFW, racist, trolling, fake news or inappropriate posts will be considered, in which case runner's up will be selected. @steemvoter has the final word as to which post is selected for the daily vote.\n\n+ We will not vote the same author in a seven-day window.\n\n+ **Cut-off time:** We will choose the highest value comment nomination within 48 hours of this post becoming active. Please only submit posts that are still within their 7 day voting window, and allow enough time for the guild vote to be done before their payout window closes. \n\n+ This is not about curation rewards for the guild members and getting in early on the vote etc, it is purely to reward the deserving author.\n\n+ @steemvoter will consider this a free market experiment and we will facilitate the voting of the post that the community wants voted, without checking for PLG of content, photos and artwork. At our discretion, blatantly inappropriate posts will not be voted on however.\n\n+ This is a beta guild project and terms are subject to change at any time. \n\n# Let's make Steem great ... together!!\n\n <hr>\n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexGbcEFRk2RsNjb3g8x3xWFYZuXmNptdAFgEDpThsYGi/image.png)</center>\n\n\n# The Steemvoter Guild\n\nIf you are not already a part of our **[SV Guild](http://www.steemit.com/@steemvoter)** please support our service and the authors we uplift by signing up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/); add your Steem account and make sure the **\"Guild\"** checkbox is enabled for each account you load on the dashboard. \n\nIn addition, you will be able to use our bot service to select your own authors to auto-vote; the guild vote is an additional daily donation to a deserving Steem author. \n\nSteemvoter is a public curation bot with an easy to use interface, it truly is a bot for the people, making automatic curation on Steemit easy with just a few clicks.\n\nThis is a payment post! Thank you for allowing us to use your Steem accounts to upvote this post by virtue of your free subscription to our bot service! \n\nAnyone not signed up at [steemvoter.com](https://steemvoter.com/) is welcome to do so or just vote this post to help the project.\n\n**And if you missed it, be sure to check out our [Steemvoter Week In Review for June 19 - 24](https://steemit.com/steemvoter/@steemvoter/steemvoter-week-in-review-for-june-19-24) for previous guild vote winners & Steemvoter news.**\n\n<hr>\n\n## Paying for Premium Services with Bitcoin and other Alt Coins\n\nOur premium services allow you up to 500 voting rules regardless of your Steem Power holdings, and exempts you from our daily self-vote payment posts, however you can still choose to add the @steemvoter account to your rules and decide your own timing to vote our posts. To pay for premium services send 3 SBD to the @steemvoter account for a one month subscription or multiples of 3 SBD for a bulk payment. \n\nWe have been asked recently if we accept Bitcoin as payment, the [blocktrades.us](https://www.blocktrades.us/) service allows you to convert Bitcoin and several altcoins, including Ether, Bitshares, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin and more into Steem or Steem Dollars and have it sent to the Steem account of your choosing. \n\nAs per the screenshot below, you can select the Bitcoin and SBD pair, populate the SBD field with 3 SBD (or multiples of 3), the receive address with **steemvoter** and **your Steem account name** in the memo field. As easy as that!\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmekF5Z3M9xGa7qiicyAS1ARRuX81DkU7aur6H7mdvGbxF/image.png)\n\n-------------------\n\n## Should you require any assistance with our service please contact @cryptomancer in the [#steemvoter.com channel on steemit.chat](https://steemit.chat/channel/steemvoter.com).\n\n-----------------------\n\n## A witness vote for our co-owner @thecryptodrive would be much appreciated if you can spare it.
