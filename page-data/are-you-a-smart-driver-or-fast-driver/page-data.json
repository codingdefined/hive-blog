You might ask what is the difference. \n\nThe difference is the condition of Road. Not all parts of the world have good roads where you can ride above 100 KMPH. That being said you need not have to ride it over it always, you have to ride safely that makes you a smart driver.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcmDqfzMoE5SrPRPrG3t87ihGK29oV32LtcdvTfAfnXcv/image.png)\nPC: https://pixabay.com/en/motorcycle-accident-road-traffic-1041070/\n\nI ride 40 KMs through and fro every day on my motorbike and my ideal speed is 60 KMPH, that does not mean that I am not capable of riding over 100 KMPH. This is because I know that on Indian City Roads (e.g. Bangalore) it is safe to ride below 60 KMPH. When I hit highway my speed goes up to 80 KMPH, because i know the condition of highway roads are much better than the city roads.\n\nThere is no special skill required to ride a motorbike above 100 KMPH, you just have to press the accelerator and the motorbike which is capable of riding at that speed will do its job. But you have to think that it needs practice to handle the motorbike on that speed.\n\nI see so many teenagers riding at a fast speed which gives them Kick, but that also lead to so many accidents. One of the accident was of a famous cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin's son Mohammad Ayazuddin whose Suzuki 1000-cc superbike skidded and crashed.","created":"May 06, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Are you a Smart driver or Fast driver?","permlink":"are-you-a-smart-driver-or-fast-driver","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Friday Blue - India Gate from a Distance","permlink":"colorchallenge-friday-blue-india-gate-from-a-distance"},"next":{"title":"Nice Opportunity to Showcase your Steemit Application to Dev Community outside of Steemit","permlink":"nice-opportunity-to-showcase-your-steemit-application-to-dev-community-outside-of-steemit"}}}}
