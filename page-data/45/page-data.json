Consider digital offline storage, such as a flash drive or burned CD, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.\nIf your account is valuable, treat it like a valuable!\n\nLike Steemit you need to remember a lot of passwords with different combinations of password like your Windows Login, Emails, Social Media and stuff. This is were KeePass will come in handy, it will store all your password into one place and you do not need to remember all your password just one i.e. master password of KeyPass. \n\nThe advantage of using KeePass is that, it keeps all your password in a most encrypted database which can be opened by a Master Password as well as it stores all your password in a single database which can be transferred from one system to another to keep the backup of your password.  Along with that it have a group feature, like if you want to store master, active and psoting key of your steemit, just create a group called Steemit and store all your password there. \n\nKeePass (https://keepass.info/) is an open source that means it is free for life. As I said it is open source if you are not satisfied with their encryption algorithm you can always use yours (for all the geeks out there).\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT2uH29nEfZsw1gxoJJMWXQQXf2QuArucq6SsbJpa7mSy/image.png)\nPC : Keepass.info\n\nI use Keypass to store all my password of Steemit and other applications where I need to remember password.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRThGxaKDyuSNcrxCvszSoXwSAL7MCfAq1vWC2sSC3ogy/image.png)\n\nSo why wait and remember your password just download KeyPass and then you need not have to remember your password anytime, just a master password will do :).\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"steemit\",\"technology\",\"ocd-resteem\",\"india\",\"tutorial\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmT2uH29nEfZsw1gxoJJMWXQQXf2QuArucq6SsbJpa7mSy\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmRThGxaKDyuSNcrxCvszSoXwSAL7MCfAq1vWC2sSC3ogy\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/keepass.info\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"3a08d951-0d4c-5d6f-aade-add2f28a2750","title":"BWPhotoContest : Theme #landscape -Multiple Entries","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 07, 2017","permlink":"bwphotocontest-theme-landscape-multiple-entries","body":"# <center> Namaste, Have a great day everyone</center>\n\n### <center>Here are my multiple entries for the BWPhotoContest   ( theme #landscape) organized by @daveks</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n##### <center>All the images were taken in Kodagu (Coorg), Karnataka India</center>\n\n# <center>1st Entry</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170908_153438~3.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZdgkmhbiwwmJpgCHP1fLJhD2fUSRhgChbMmtNSHc5cxk/IMG_20170908_153438~3.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center>2nd Entry</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170909_131026~2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT2UjkgBXqFNkoWMbSDJBXP8iRJEftWUx1Py7a6JSiiNi/IMG_20170909_131026~2.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center>3rd Entry</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20170909_143109~2.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcx6sWuf5XAbEvwXjUTwnhpor5q47Aobd5eM48r2SDE9P/IMG_20170909_143109~2.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center>Camera : Nokia 6, Converted to B/W</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n# <center> Follow @codingdefined </center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"bwphotocontest\",\"photography\",\"contest\",\"landscape\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"daveks\",\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZdgkmhbiwwmJpgCHP1fLJhD2fUSRhgChbMmtNSHc5cxk\\/IMG_20170908_153438~3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmT2UjkgBXqFNkoWMbSDJBXP8iRJEftWUx1Py7a6JSiiNi\\/IMG_20170909_131026~2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmcx6sWuf5XAbEvwXjUTwnhpor5q47Aobd5eM48r2SDE9P\\/IMG_20170909_143109~2.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"4f5547f6-8076-5783-a20d-de0d9f31391f","title":"#ColorChallenge -

But it was unable to find the new tokens or some tokens. This was really frustrating a bit.**\n\nSo then we came up with an idea of making a bot that could find the prices of all the tokens. In this even we ran through a lot of ideas. And the bot is still in development. The bot will be completed soon. And it's looking good at the moment. The accuracy of the bot is very high. \n\n**We are just making it more advanced in-terms in finding the token you are looking.**\n\n# Bitbot Info:\nBitbot is an advanced version of Banjo. We knew that banjo can't figure out all the tokens and that it uses the **WorldCoinIndex**. Bitbot uses the CoinMarketCap for more accurate information. In few days the bot will be able to notify us when a new token is added in Coin Market Cap. This can help us keep track of the tokens and that you don't miss it. **The Bot is developed by @codingdefined**. \n\n# The bot commands: \nThe bot works with the \"$\" command. There are various commands for the bot. **Below are the commands list and what they do.**\n\n```Javascript\n1) $price <coin>\nThis will tell you the price of the token you asked for.\n\n2) $accounts\nWill tell you the total accounts in Steemit.\n\n3) $hot <tag name>\nThis will tell you the hottest post that is there with the specified tag.\n\n4) $trending <tag name>\nThis will tell you the trending post with the specified tag. \n\n5) $created <tag>\nThis will give you the new post that was made in steemit using the tag. \n```\n\n# Commands that we will be adding. \n```Javascript\n1) $top10\nThis will tell you the top 10 coins with reference to coinmarketcap data, \n\n2) $rank <number>\nThis will trigger the specified ranked token. Eg. $rank 1 (will trigger bitcoin)\n\n3) $new \nThis will let you know the latest token that was added to CMC. \n\n4) $latest <steemit user name>\nThis will find the recent of the latest post by the specified user. eg. ($latest manishmike10) \n\n```\n# What does this offer. \nThis bot offers the crypto enthusiast people to find the token that they are looking for. \n\nThis gives the benefit to the Curators to curate the new post and find the post they are looking for. They do not need to go to steemit to find the post. \n\n# Glimpses of usage. \n![Screenshot (262).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeiiWiBdqbJkmuhKwNMp3SFTmd6fqRCDP8DWowVwx3fAA/Screenshot%20(262).png)\n\n****\n****\n![Screenshot (263).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmS4C82poPGRyaRaqbTMod5Wn1RSfMHmxE24wJAxyxMEqs/Screenshot%20(263).png)\n****\n*****\n![Screenshot (264).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP6fce4P6DrEjdhrWLfuKTqiEVqVQvsP1nLBZErDVSSc3/Screenshot%20(264).png)\n****\n****\n### If you want to test the bot, feel free to DM me in Discord and I will invite you to the server.

A graphical image is one where thousands of pixels arranged in rows and columns and they are so small that they appear connected. \n\nNow a grayscale image like above has a storage value for each and every pixel where the pixel value can range from 0 (complete black) to 255 (complete white). \n\nSo if we do a math this image has total 65536 pixels (256 x 256). Now since every pixel can have 256 different value (0 to 255) there can be total of 16777216 (256 * 65536) images from all black images to all white images.\n\n16777216 is a huge number and we get a lot of images, but all the images are not perfect. There might be some useless images too which has lot of noises.\n\nHowever the important thing is \"All your b/w images can be created using the single image\" which means in this 16777216 images there will be an image of you when you are born, a image of that school going kid, the picture of you now and also an image of you when you will get old. It will contain all the images which shows the world at its origin as well as when it will end. Picture of every animal which would ever exist.\n\nAnd it is very easy to write a program which shows each and every picture. The algorithm of the program will be simple you have to create an image with starting value of all the 65536 pixels as 0 and then you need to change one pixel at a time.\n\nNote: 256 pixels is chosen as a random number. Only a few of 16777216 images will be perceivable to the human eye that means a lot of images will not have any meaning. Creating all the images is not realistic as it will take years to process.
