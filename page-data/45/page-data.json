The answer to this question is their creativeness. Just pick up any successful people and you will see they have done things differently which is nothing but the creativity which they apply on whatever they do. The creativity can be applied to anything you do whether you paint, dance, take photos, or you are in any specific fields like medicine, science, engineering etc.\n\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSKKGCa4qTZr54qsUZesQNFAkrL1gvxPZuVfQXtJfNSn1/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/inspiration-idea-design-success-2706595/)\n\nThe best thing about creativity is that it brings innovation as well. Let's take an example, let's say you do photography, so next time when you try to capture try to be little creative (different angle, keep the focus on a different place), you will notice a change then and there.\n\nWe all humans have the gift of creativity but we lack the ability to know how to be creative. So if you haven't been creative enough then start learning a different form of creativeness in your field and you will notice the change simultaneously. Before being creative you have to let go your fear of failure or thinking too much ahead. Just start from simple things and then take it to the next level. Always keep a simple goal ahead, what you need to do next and don't think too much at once (that is impossible to get).\n\nIf you are aware that what is stopping you from being creative then you are the best person to know how to move past that obstruction. Move out from your personal space and generate a new idea like you have never done before. Again if you think creative then the ideas will start to flow. Thus when ideas will start it eventually inspire you to change your course of action.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaqG955sHcGREPxs7QYWjbNoEnTAp7aNXYLfp3Ak5Kz1c/image.png)\nPC : [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/question-questions-man-head-2519654/)\n\nNow to give you an example, let say you take a lot of photos and think how to be more creative in that. My suggestion would be to start editing your photos with few colours here and there, try blurring it out. Now that's enough to get you going. \n\nSo all the creative minds out there just start thinking creatively and you will get a lot of ideas. One more good news for you is that the art of creativenss can be cultivated with the help of practice. You need to be consistent, patient and start practice, you will notice it soon.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"india\",\"creative\",\"writing\",\"discussion\",\"life\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmSKKGCa4qTZr54qsUZesQNFAkrL1gvxPZuVfQXtJfNSn1\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaqG955sHcGREPxs7QYWjbNoEnTAp7aNXYLfp3Ak5Kz1c\\/image.png\"],\"links\":[\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/inspiration-idea-design-success-2706595\\/\",\"https:\\/\\/pixabay.com\\/en\\/question-questions-man-head-2519654\\/\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"768877cd-afbf-52e4-ab93-a4cc0cfb0c2f","title":"ðŸ“· #ColorChallenge - Tuesday Orange - A Beautiful Sunset ðŸ“·","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 10, 2017","permlink":"colorchallenge-tuesday-orange-a-beautiful-sunset","body":"### <center> Namaste, Have a great day everyone </center>\n\n<hr>\n\n###  <center>My today's entry for #colorchallenge by @kalemandra </center>\n\n <hr>\n\n## <center>  A Beautiful Sunset in Bangalore </center>\n\n>When I admire the wonders of a sunset or the beauty of the moon, my soul expands in the worship of the creator - Mahatma Gandhi\n\n<hr>\n\n![IMG_20171003_180154.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZRd1tbpQeoJqYL3puWMWZwMmdS3FikALriGjcSgBksgL/IMG_20171003_180154.jpg)\n\n![IMG_20171003_180203.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaPzKranMEks7LJWMzsh4EogbWZKGBkmGrJragZRPHcYn/IMG_20171003_180203.jpg)\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Camera - Nokia 6, No Editing</center>\n\n<hr>\n\n### <center>Follow @codingdefined</center>","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"colorchallenge\",\"goldenhourphotography\",\"india\",\"photography\",\"sunset\"],\"users\":[\"kalemandra\",\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZRd1tbpQeoJqYL3puWMWZwMmdS3FikALriGjcSgBksgL\\/IMG_20171003_180154.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmaPzKranMEks7LJWMzsh4EogbWZKGBkmGrJragZRPHcYn\\/IMG_20171003_180203.jpg\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"aa4e454e-a097-5375-a8c1-3eb9c4092b14","title":"KeyPass to Store your Steemit Password Safely","author":"codingdefined","created":"October 07, 2017","permlink":"keypass-to-store-your-steemit-password-safely","body":"So after joining Steemit if you go to the Welcome page, you will notice that it's clearly written never lose your password, your account is valuable treat it like a valuable asset by keeping your password safe.\n\n>You are entirely responsible for keeping your password and keeping it secure.\nSave your master key and keep it somewhere safe.\nIt is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as a flash drive or burned CD, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.\nIf your account is valuable, treat it like a valuable!\n\nLike Steemit you need to remember a lot of passwords with different combinations of password like your Windows Login, Emails, Social Media and stuff. This is were KeePass will come in handy, it will store all your password into one place and you do not need to remember all your password just one i.e. master password of KeyPass. \n\nThe advantage of using KeePass is that, it keeps all your password in a most encrypted database which can be opened by a Master Password as well as it stores all your password in a single database which can be transferred from one system to another to keep the backup of your password.  Along with that it have a group feature, like if you want to store master, active and psoting key of your steemit, just create a group called Steemit and store all your password there. \n\nKeePass (https://keepass.info/) is an open source that means it is free for life.

But it was unable to find the new tokens or some tokens. This was really frustrating a bit.**\n\nSo then we came up with an idea of making a bot that could find the prices of all the tokens. In this even we ran through a lot of ideas. And the bot is still in development. The bot will be completed soon. And it's looking good at the moment. The accuracy of the bot is very high. \n\n**We are just making it more advanced in-terms in finding the token you are looking.**\n\n# Bitbot Info:\nBitbot is an advanced version of Banjo. We knew that banjo can't figure out all the tokens and that it uses the **WorldCoinIndex**. Bitbot uses the CoinMarketCap for more accurate information. In few days the bot will be able to notify us when a new token is added in Coin Market Cap. This can help us keep track of the tokens and that you don't miss it. **The Bot is developed by @codingdefined**. \n\n# The bot commands: \nThe bot works with the \"$\" command. There are various commands for the bot. **Below are the commands list and what they do.**\n\n```Javascript\n1) $price <coin>\nThis will tell you the price of the token you asked for.\n\n2) $accounts\nWill tell you the total accounts in Steemit.\n\n3) $hot <tag name>\nThis will tell you the hottest post that is there with the specified tag.\n\n4) $trending <tag name>\nThis will tell you the trending post with the specified tag. \n\n5) $created <tag>\nThis will give you the new post that was made in steemit using the tag. \n```\n\n# Commands that we will be adding. \n```Javascript\n1) $top10\nThis will tell you the top 10 coins with reference to coinmarketcap data, \n\n2) $rank <number>\nThis will trigger the specified ranked token. Eg. $rank 1 (will trigger bitcoin)\n\n3) $new \nThis will let you know the latest token that was added to CMC. \n\n4) $latest <steemit user name>\nThis will find the recent of the latest post by the specified user. eg. ($latest manishmike10) \n\n```\n# What does this offer. \nThis bot offers the crypto enthusiast people to find the token that they are looking for. \n\nThis gives the benefit to the Curators to curate the new post and find the post they are looking for. They do not need to go to steemit to find the post. \n\n# Glimpses of usage. \n![Screenshot (262).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeiiWiBdqbJkmuhKwNMp3SFTmd6fqRCDP8DWowVwx3fAA/Screenshot%20(262).png)\n\n****\n****\n![Screenshot (263).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmS4C82poPGRyaRaqbTMod5Wn1RSfMHmxE24wJAxyxMEqs/Screenshot%20(263).png)\n****\n*****\n![Screenshot (264).png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmP6fce4P6DrEjdhrWLfuKTqiEVqVQvsP1nLBZErDVSSc3/Screenshot%20(264).png)\n****\n****\n### If you want to test the bot, feel free to DM me in Discord and I will invite you to the server.
