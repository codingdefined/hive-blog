Maybe they are a good friend, or maybe someone you met through Steemit! \n\n<center>https://i.imgur.com/Oa1P5l6.png</center>\n\nAs we all know, @steemfest 2 is coming up and some people are craving to join this great event but unfortunately do not have the sufficient funds to attend. \n\nThis is your chance to give something back to the community!
