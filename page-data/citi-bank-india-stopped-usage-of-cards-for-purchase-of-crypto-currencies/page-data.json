Financially people will become sound because it is one way of investment, I don't think it as a financial risk. They say legal risks, according to RBI there is no such notice to stop purchasing bitcoins or cryptocurrencies to it should not be legal. They talk about Customer Protection, are we really protected as you are the ones who give our details to credit card department and they call us numerous times in a day. \n\n![Screenshot_20180213-195936_2.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeT83JiEzFYnnRQ4VaS5KyhUiAUb87hRtrwNNZA5d4d2G/Screenshot_20180213-195936_2.png)\n\nYour thoughts on this?","created":"February 13, 2018"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Citi Bank India Stopped Usage of Cards for Purchase of Crypto Currencies","permlink":"citi-bank-india-stopped-usage-of-cards-for-purchase-of-crypto-currencies","previous":{"title":"ColorChallenge - Tuesday Orange - An Art","permlink":"colorchallenge-tuesday-orange-an-art"},"next":{"title":"Blue Sky with a Beautiful Sunset","permlink":"blue-sky-with-a-beautiful-sunset"}}}}
