And when it comes to entrepreneurship, the business models ranges from low to high risk.\n\nBut this doesn't mean you can take blind risks.\n\nRisk can be reduced with intellect.\n\nIntellect comes from experience, relationships with experienced people and learning new things.\n\nElon Musk took a big risk by starting SpaceX, but it would be an even bigger risk for someone like us to start it.\n\nHe is probably the only person in the world to have the least amount of risk in starting SpaceX.\n\nSo higher the intellect = lower the risk.\n\nI can start a new e-commerce business and make it successful and in my scale I will be operating at low risk - but for a college fresher, it might be a higher risk.\n\nRisk cannot be eliminated 100%, but can be reduced as much as possible with efforts in our reach.","created":"July 10, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"High risk = high returns and Low risk = low returns.","permlink":"high-risk-high-returns-and-low-risk-low-returns","previous":{"title":"Post deleted as a result of Steemcleaners' abuses.","permlink":"some-mushrooms-in-my-region-sardinia-italy-10-photos-by-sard-rt"},"next":{"title":"Open mic week 41...
