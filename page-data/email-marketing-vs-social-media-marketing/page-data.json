The only thing that your follower see on his screen is your message.\n\nThat is why I always recommend my clients to start with email marketing before they think of social media marketing.\n\nNot only for selling, even if you are using email marketing to keep your readers updated about new articles on your blog or website.\n\nChances are more that they will click on the link that they receive in their email rather than clicking on the link that they see in their Facebook news feed.","created":"July 05, 2017"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Email Marketing VS Social Media Marketing","permlink":"email-marketing-vs-social-media-marketing","previous":{"title":"City Palace, Udaipur","permlink":"city-palace-udaipur"},"next":{"title":"Quick SteemFestÂ² Update: Visiting Lisbon & Sponsorships","permlink":"quick-steemfest-update-visiting-lisbon-and-sponsorships"}}}}
