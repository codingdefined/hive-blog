It is located 86  km north of Coimbatore and 158  km south of Mysore and is the capital of the Nilgiris district. It is a popular hill station located in the Nilgiri Hills.\n\n>Originally occupied by the Toda, the area came under the rule of the East India Company at the end of the 18th century. The economy is based on tourism and agriculture, along with the manufacture of medicines and photographic film. The town is connected by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway. Its natural environment attracts tourists and it is a popular summer destination. As of 2011, the town had a population of 88,430.\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZPDdbPjePP3cYZE2HPdBbF4Rn7x9GVJFU5R9GLeMMnpj/image.png)\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQSsroouvY5ufxCRpmY8FAh3ovUwagDYfaKRzTHy9Unbb/image.png)\n\n![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeDdFd3ntCLt3uvE618rk5XB6FgpYuGSitnSFRhrVY62c/image.png)\n\n# Upvote, Follow, Resteem @codingdefined","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"travel\",\"photo\",\"photography\",\"india\"],\"users\":[\"codingdefined\"],\"image\":[\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmZPDdbPjePP3cYZE2HPdBbF4Rn7x9GVJFU5R9GLeMMnpj\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmQSsroouvY5ufxCRpmY8FAh3ovUwagDYfaKRzTHy9Unbb\\/image.png\",\"https:\\/\\/steemitimages.com\\/DQmeDdFd3ntCLt3uvE618rk5XB6FgpYuGSitnSFRhrVY62c\\/image.png\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"0b9c7338-67d4-5e5c-8b14-0aeea0be0a3e","title":"Ganapati Bappa Mourya - Homemade Sweets","author":"preeti","created":"August 25, 2017","permlink":"ganapati-bappa-mourya-homemade-sweets-2017825t1130399z","body":"Today is a Hindu festival celebrated all over India and its called Ganesh Chaturthi.

Do you know Brad Pitt, Steven Spielberg and many are becoming vegetarian due to the health concerns? According to American Diabetic Association vegetarians are at lower risk for developing Heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There are a number of reasons for becoming vegetarian. Some people are vegetarian because they are following some religion. Some people are vegetarian because they are against animal cruelty. Some believe that being vegetarian is overall a healthy diet to follow. \n\nHow many times have you asked a vegetarian why they are vegetarian and end up having an argument with them. The most common question to vegetarians is, what you eat since you don't have enough varieties of food.\n \nAccording to a great scientist Einstein: \"Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.\" And I can proudly say I am a Vegeterian.","json_metadata":"{\"tags\":[\"vegetarian\",\"story\",\"writing\",\"health\",\"food\"],\"app\":\"steemit\\/0.1\",\"format\":\"markdown\"}"}},{"node":{"id":"726b56fc-32e1-5727-b69e-dc1b5887352c","title":"Maharajas' Express in India","author":"codingdefined","created":"August 23, 2017","permlink":"maharajas-express-in-india","body":"In my last post, I have discussed about one of the luxurious trains in India [Palace on Wheels](https://steemit.com/luxury/@codingdefined/palace-on-wheels-in-india).
