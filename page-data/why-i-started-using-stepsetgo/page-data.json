Our own Actifit is one such example, the only reason of not using it that I have to write my daily activities which looks repetitive for me.\n\nSimilarly I came across an app called StepSetGo which is again rewards users based on their activity. It takes your step from Google Fit app, though you don't have to install it for using StepSetGo.\n\n![8ls3s1upjm.png](https://img.esteem.ws/8ls3s1upjm.png)\n\nThe concept of rewarding is different. You need to maintain your level for 3 days otherwise you will be downgraded, if you achieve the highest coins of your level for 3 days you will be upgraded. There are mainly 5 levels as shown below:\n\nIn the first level you can get up to 5 coins and this is one of the easiest level. If you are walking outside you get 1.25 coins for every 1000 steps whereas if you are walking basic steps you get 1 coins for every 1000 steps. Now for getting 5 coins you need maximum 5000 steps. When you get 5 coins for 3 days you will be upgraded to level 2.\n\n![u9paljbtdu.png](https://img.esteem.ws/u9paljbtdu.png)\n\nIn level 2 you need to get 5 coins to stay in level 2 every 3 days. If you do not get 5 coins consecutive for 3 days you will get downgraded to level 1. In the level 2, you need to get 10 coins for 3 days to get upgraded to level 3.\n\n![bnlrfqlgft.png](https://img.esteem.ws/bnlrfqlgft.png)\n\nIn level 3 the safe zone is 10 coins whereas the maximum you can get is 15 coins.\n\n![jhmaklky3m.png](https://img.esteem.ws/jhmaklky3m.png)\n\nIn level 4, the safe zone is 15 coins whereas the maximum is 20 coins.\n\n![5j6iwsnnxn.png](https://img.esteem.ws/5j6iwsnnxn.png)\n\nI think level 5 is the most toughest zone because you need to get 25 coins to be safe whereas maximum you can take is 30 coins.\n\n![ssu1n1oqej.png](https://img.esteem.ws/ssu1n1oqej.png)\n\nI think Level 5 is the toughest level because getting 25 coins means you need to walk atleast 20K steps. I am at level 4 and trying to be in level 4 itself for sometime before moving to level 5.\n\n![juu3vja5vt.png](https://img.esteem.ws/juu3vja5vt.png)\n\nYou can also see how much you have walked till now and the coin balance.\n\n![tmp9r1e77p.png](https://img.esteem.ws/tmp9r1e77p.png)\n\nNow when you have accumulated coins you can buy or get discounts based on your purchase in Bazzar or market. When you get 15000 coins you can redeem IPhone X from that coin isn't it cool.\n\nWhy I really like this app is not about the coins mainly but because you can actually compete with your friends to see who can walk more in a week thus a sense of competition also helps the cause of keeping users motivated. Also there are ways to get more coins when you are on a higher level thus you tend to walk the minimum steps in 3 days just to keep yourself on that level.\n\nHave you used StepSetGo, how was your experience?","created":"December 27, 2019"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Why I started using StepSetGo","permlink":"why-i-started-using-stepsetgo","previous":{"title":"A Red Flower Amidst Greenery","permlink":"a-red-flower-amidst-greenery"},"next":{"title":"2019 Year in Review","permlink":"2019-year-in-review"}}}}
