An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key. An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key.**

While this seems obvious, some fail to grasp it. You can use this private key to import your _Ethereum Wallet_ into most _Ethereum Wallet Clients_. _Always do plenty of research on a wallet before you drop a private key into it and make sure it's secure and is void of vulnerabilities. Crypto is about [Personal Responsibility](https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds), and nothing myself or anyone says should ever supplement it. This is **NOT** a claim that MEW is free of vulnerabilities, that is for you to decide_. 

The process is usually relatively easy, because after all, **_an Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key_.** As the title implies, this guide is focused on importing into MyEtherWallet (These steps can be extrapolated to Parity/GETH CLI, Ethereum-Wallet, MIST and Ethereum Web Wallet as well, but I have not found any guides... _hint hint_)

**Your best bet** is probably to never expose your private key, ever, choose a wallet and stick with it or even better, use cold storage or offline tx signing. However, these are not always feasible for more advanced operations like interacting with a contract on Ethereum Mainnet. And sometimes, this might be your only option.

The problems with MetaMask have been observed while aiding people with [EOS Crowdsale](http://eos.io). Whether it was a DDoS, or slow nodes, it quickly became obvious that interacting with the contract directly through Ethereum-Wallet or MyEtherWallet may be more accessible for **advanced users.**

# Protect yourself
It's probably not a great idea to use the online version of MyEtherWallet for high value wallets. If you are dealing with a high value wallet, you should educate yourself about Offline Signatures with MEW. The "most secure" way, is to have an offline computer that is never connected to the internet where you handle your private keys. You can then sign a transaction from that computer, and with the generated QR code broadcast the transaction from an internet enabled device. This is referred to as "Air Gapping." It's recommended that you research these principles to protect yourself against the unthinkable. Otherwise, consider a less convenient and user friendly route, like Parity. You can never be too safe. 

# Understand the risks
**An Ethereum wallet is nothing more than a private key.** It's dangerous to move private keys, so dangerous, that most wallets go through great lengths to encrypt them and make them inaccessible to reduce their attack vector. Here's only a few of the ways these unencrypted keys to your wallet could be compromised:
- Accidentally paste them somewhere public, like a chat
- Compromised system or wallet client software.
- Accidentally pasting and appending to a URL in an address bar and then hitting the server consequently creating the possibility that they are in a server log
- Falling for a phishing site, like [this one](https://steemit.com/mew/@sandwich/alert-myetherwallet-phishing-site)
- Compromised server hosting MyEtherWallet. If the server hosting MyEtherWallet were compromised, you could subsequently compromise your key. 
- Social hack on MyEtherWallet's hosting company could result in DNS resolution to an attackers server, like with what happened to **Classic Ethereum Wallet**
- _A handful of other ways..._

_BTW... If any of these ever happens to you, your wallet is burned, and it's time to move all assets from your burned wallet to a newly generated or another existing Ethereum wallet quickly._

# Disclaimer
**THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR TOKEN LOSS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT MYETHERWALLET IS FREE OF VULNERABILITIES, WHICH IS TRUE WITH ALL SOFTWARE. MEW HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY AUDITED. ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN TRANSACTING VALUE ON A BLOCKCHAIN. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT FOR THE SECURITY OF MYETHERWALLET**

_So if you're the kind of person who isn't good with words (you know who you are): While I have personally checked source code for foul-play this is not an endorsement that it is free of defects or foul play. You should do this yourself. I have never exhaustively audited MEW for vulnerabilities, nor am I aware of any formal audit of MEW. I am not claiming that MEW is secure._ To provide some balance to this statement, it does have 2 years of battle-testing, is open-source with a [number of contributors.](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/graphs/contributors) and is a widely used wallet in the Ethereum community.

So now that it's out of of the way...

# Export Private key from MetaMask
1. Click the key in MetaMask, seen below
![Screen Shot 2017-07-04 at 4.00.06 AM.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeGv8HHhBPh45yBBqo29Bdi62cXo5qPfFKFuLVJ8hhQFn/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-04%20at%204.00.06%20AM.png)
2. Enter MetaMask password
3. Copy the private key

# Import Private key into MEW

When sending a transaction or executing a payable/writeable function in a contract from MEW, you'll be asked to load your wallet, like below. 

1. Select `Private Key` 
2. Enter your private key from last step
3. click `unlock`
![Screen Shot 2017-07-04 at 4.00.55 AM.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQCaUqKsowEA6JYxCjioDaUfMXVMEvHBFLzs3CYUQNtfX/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-04%20at%204.00.55%20AM.png)

If using the online version of MEW, you will need to enter this every time. This is to protect you. If you're using the Chrome version, you can actually save wallets for later use. 

# Sandwich's Paranoiac Rituals
- _Take a deep breath and **move slowly**_
- **Select random string of text somewhere and copy it to clear private keys from your clipboard.** This will help mitigate accidents. If you want some 1337 points, research how to clear your clipboard on your OS from CLI for some added coverage. 
- Run MyEtherWallet locally
- Use Offline Signing (more advanced)
- Run a local parity node

# Fellow Steemians,

---

**We're excited to announce that @hansikhouse and I will be producing a short documentary film for STEEM Park, to be released in just a few weeks from now!** Take a look at [the announcement on the @hitheryon page here.](https://steemit.com/steempark/@hitheryon/announcing-the-steem-park-documentary-film-project)

# Film Goals
---

* **Introduce the Steemit Platform**
* **Showcase STEEM Park (process + final product)**
* **5-8 minutes in length**
* **High quality content and professional editing. To ensure this, we've partnered with [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/) (an award winning New York City based film company)**

# A Journey Worth Documenting
---

Last week, we were super excited to [announce Steemit Inc's official support of Steem Park!](https://steemit.com/steempark/@hitheryon/steem-park-is-official-steemit-s-first-crowdsourced-marketing-project) It has been an incredible few months developing this project and the support we received from the community has been overwhelming. So before we start this post, we want to send out another resounding THANK YOU!

When we, @voronoi and @hansikhouse, first started collaborating again on a joint Steemit account, we had big dreams of what Steemit could do for the design community from the beginning. Steemit, blockchain, and the development of social-media equity could completely transform how we make things, especially in regards to the public like parks, waterfronts, playgrounds, and so on. STEEM Park will not only be an opportunity to showcase Steemit and build a fun park, *it will be the world's first public-interest project funded by public-interest.*

https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmNS4CgFzB9ZZ9i8Wk14HvLhWD15FfnzoCHySYquzgLqV2/Pop-Up_Garden_Final-Gif.gif

That's why this project is such an incredible thing for us. It is an opportunity to revolutionize a profession that has historically relied on deep private-interest pockets. STEEM Park is a journey to prove that blockchain technology can be the new economic foundation for how we make this world.

There was no way that we would limit this ambition to just a month's worth of posts. We wanted to make a stand and show the world that Steemit is a powerful new force to be reckoned with and had the potential to shake up content-production industries around the world. So we came up with an idea...

# A Film Showcasing Steemit's Generative Power

---

A couple weeks ago, we met with the founding directors of [The Timelapse Group](http://www.thetimelapsegroup.com/), New York City's premiere filmmakers for process-based work and development. After an extensive conversation about Steemit and STEEM Park, we collectively decided that a film would be the best way to showcase this effort.

We're super pumped about having The Timelapse Group onboard for this. They're an award winning company with a portfolio ranging from several Forbes 500 companies to Vimeo Staff Picks and an array of other accolades. These guys are legit and are already on their way of forwarding that talent into STEEM Park!

Right now, you are reading this answer. Now think about it. This might very well be the last thing you ever do. There is no power in this universe that can guarantee you that you’re going to live for one more second!

Remember all those dreams that you have, that you know you will fulfill. Starting tomorrow, of course. But you damn sure will. And all those burning desires you got kicking around in your head? One day, you’re gonna make all of them a reality. One day!

Why tomorrow? Why not today? Because you’ve got all the time in the world. Because you just kind of assume that you’re going to live up to 60? Why? Because statistics say that that is what the average human lifespan is. But isn’t that stupid? The average marks of a class might be 60, but ten might still fail. Do you see it? How illogical your assumption is?

In your head, you build this fantasy, of what you will do tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. You chalk out these beautiful plans of what your life would look like 5 years or 10 years down the line. You visualize them so clearly in your head that you can actually see yourself living that life.

And then you go ahead, and use these images to justify your procrastination, your tendency of always living in the future. I’ll ask her out tomorrow. One day when the time is right, I’ll quit my job and start my own startup. You just wait. I’m gonna do it.

Because in your mind you’ve already done it. Remember those beautiful images? Our innocent brains take them literally. As if all those things have already been achieved. Visualizing something with enough intensity causes the same dopamine rush as actually achieving it. That’s why you feel so good with the images of a fantastic future that you build.

Guess what?

These images are a lie. A fantasy. A mirage.

Living up to 60? You don’t even know if you’re going to wake up tomorrow!

And you still think you have time?</p></section></article><article><header><h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4375rem"><a style="box-shadow:none" href="/dispute-between-india-and-china">Dispute between India and China</a></h3><small>July 03, 2017</small></header><section><img class="img-body" srcSet="noimage.png" alt="dispute-between-india-and-china"/><p class="hive-body">The McMahon line, which India recognises as its boundary, is not accepted by the Chinese. The line was drawn by Sir Henry McMahon, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government who was acting as the chief negotiator in the Shimla conference between Britain, China and Tibet. 

The Chinese delegate, Ivan Chen, stated he was not authorised to discuss Tibet's border with India. The McMahon line was negotiated between the British and Tibetans, without Chinese participation and when opposed by the Chinese it was declared as a bilateral accord between India and Tibet. The land south of Tibet was declared as British India. This made the Tawang region of Arunachal Pradesh a part of India. Historically, this area was known as south Tibet. 

In 1950, Tibet lost its status as an independent territory and India took control of the area. In response to China's claim, India argues that China had no sovereignty over Tibet at the time when the McMahon line was drawn. Also historically it has had no claim to the area that is Arunchal Pradesh. It began to raise the claim after it annexed Tibet. Historically, the Ahom rajas and Debrajas of Tawang have had a tributary system with the tribes of Arunachal. 

The Tawang monastery that has links with Lhasa exercised a spiritual and not a temporal influence. The tribes of Arunachal were integrated more to the south as the high passes of 14,000 and 18,000 feet restricted contact with Tibet. There was just about 60-75 km of "border" areas where regular contact was possible. So, though some accounts see Tibet "ceding" territories to India at the Shimla conference, even ancient travellers like Hieun Tsang speak of the influence of local kingdoms. Also before China's annexation of Tibet, the latter's relations with India were by and large peaceful.</p></section></article><article><header><h3 style="margin-bottom:0.4375rem"><a style="box-shadow:none" href="/do-not-use-you-broadband-in-india">Do not use You Broadband in India</a></h3><small>July 03, 2017</small></header><section><img class="img-body" srcSet="https://i.redd.it/5oqpdz9zja7z.png" alt="do-not-use-you-broadband-in-india"/><p class="hive-body">Do not use You Broadband in India because they have 'access to copy of all packets/data from customer'

**Top 10 Cryptocurrency Questions and Answers!**

1. **What are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Steem, Ethereum, and Litecoin?**  Digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Steem are like electronic money issued and managed by users.  Servers setup by entrepreneurs and companies handle all the transactions while exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp allow changing fiat currency like USD to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which provides the real value.  Bitcoin is currently accepted as payment for goods and services on thousands if not millions of websites worldwide with continuing adoption every day.  Cryptocurrencies are also a popular choice for the black market because of relative anonymity and ease of use compared to using credit cards and bank accounts.  Digital currencies are also very popular in countries like China where moving wealth out of the national economy and into the global market is difficult.
2. **How is the value of a cryptocurrency determined and where can I see it?**  https://coinmarketcap.com/ has a list of cryptocurrencies ranked by the value of 1 unit of that currency times the cost on an exchange to buy it which equals the market capitalization.  For example, 1 Steem today is worth $1.56 on Poloniex and Bittrex as I write this.  With 235,749,278 STEEM available, that means in theory to buy every Steem at the market price today would cost $1.56 times 235,749,278 which equals a total market capitalization of $368,544,488.  As you can see these numbers are all really fiction because the price moves all the time as does the quantity available meaning no one is going to actually be able to buy all the Steem in the world with $368 million.  Still, the market capitalization gives a rough estimate of the total value today of a digital currency.
3. **What are the most exciting reasons to become involved with digital currencies?**  With the ability to transfer money in just 3 seconds to anyone in the world with a Steemit wallet without any fees, digital currencies like Steem make sending and receiving money 10 times easier than using wire transfers, PayPal, or Western Union.  Digital currencies are just like cash meaning for merchants receiving payments this way guarantees you actually get the money whereas with processing credit cards using Stripe or PayPal there is no guarantee the customer actually paid because of the ability to easily to a chargeback with almost no chance for the merchant to win.  I believe that money in the future will be primarily transacted from user to user with digital currencies meaning that buying even a little bit today may be the biggest investment opportunity going forward and an ideal retirement plan!
4. **Worst part about using cryptocurrencies?**  Lose your password or make a mistake in the transaction and you lose it just the same as if you lost your wallet or mailed cash to the wrong address.  Cryptocurrencies can be extremely unforgiving when it comes to making mistakes because many wallets are only locked with a password with no hope of getting back in if the password is lost.  To make matters worse, they are relatively easy to steal compared to say robbing a bank.  For example if your wallet is unlocked on your computer or your account is open, anyone that has physical access to your computer and knows how to make the transaction could easily clean your whole wallet out with a few clicks the same as they could taking the cash out of your wallet.  Law enforcement at less than the NSA level is not likely to be able to help out either unless the thief is sloppy beyond belief because it is easy to move any cryptocurrency through some kind of anonymous transaction that makes tracking it nearly impossible to those without access to the real time global electronic monitoring system which no one is going to allow use of to track down some stolen cryptocurrency!  Fortunately Steem has both account recovery and Steem Power both of which make it significantly more difficult to instantly clean out an entire account.  That said, I have seen at least one Steemit user accidentally send as much as $200,000 to the wrong account and thankfully the user that received it is giving it back in exchange for a 5% fee offered by the sender!

Ironically the ease of losing cryptocurrencies is also likely to drive the value up!
5. **Which cryptocurrency is best to buy today?**  The best cryptocurrency to buy is one we are willing to hold onto even if it goes down.  For example, I believe in Steem enough that I am willing to hold it even if it goes down 99% and would start buying more of it if the price dropped.  I have no intention of selling and am continuing to invest for the long term because of the supportive and energized group of users we have on Steemit!  One of the most expensive mistakes I made starting out with buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins was to buy with the belief that it should go up and therefore make me money.  When it actually went down, I got into fear and anger because the real reason I had purchased was just to make money which obviously was not working out in the short term as the price dropped.  Naturally I could only take this pressure so long and sold down low to "cut my losses" which also cut all my profits when I sold over 30 Bitcoin at around $200 in 2015 after a year of buying it and hoping to make money.  Buying into any cryptocurrency with the expectation it should make money quickly is a guaranteed way to be miserable because even if it goes up, then the pressure is on as to when to sell?  I am currently only buying Steem and investing in Steem going forward because I believe in the community of users of which I am a part.  With fiat currencies, the government issuing the money and the people using it determine the value.  Would it be a good idea to buy into whatever country's currency was hot today or recently up or had the best features?  Obviously that would be a huge risk.  The same with digital currencies.  Just buying in on hype or to make money will produce little joy even if the price goes up.  Buying in with the intention to become a long term user of that currency and to participate in its development and growth is the best opportunity.  Therefore, I suggest and am practicing only investing in digital currencies where I am willing to go through the good times and bad regardless of the price.  Steem is where I am today and where I plan to stay indefinitely!
6. **When to sell a cryptocurrency?**  Before Steem I was all in an another altcoin and really excited about it.  When I first bought the price was low and made payments to me every week just for holding it.  As I tried to participate in the community over the next several months, I was consistently met with a mix of excitement and hostility.  When I began talking openly about this, the negative emotions won over in the community and in me.  Originally I had invested and been happy to hold no matter what the price which quickly went up after I bought it.  After months of frustration in trying to be of service in helping that cryptocurrency grow, I suddenly found myself staring at the price charts with fear.  I was back to only seeing the currency as a way to make money and I knew it was time to exit because I now no longer cared if I missed out on the profits from a price increase while having the price go down had become completely unacceptable.  I sold everything just before the price doubled again but still made 7 dollars for every dollar I invested.  In other words, when the digital currency became a means to an end of making money instead of an investment I was excited about, I sold it because why have my money tied up in something I no longer care about?  I used about one third of what I sold to invest in Steem and am extremely grateful for this experience today because I learned how to make a graceful exit.  Could I have made more money by holding the other currency longer?  Sure.  Is the point of investing purely to make money?  No because the point of investing is to use money to do some good in the world and if there is no joy from investing, there is no good in it either.
7. **Where are the best websites to use for changing fiat like USD and EUR to digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Steem?**  I use Coinbase.com with Bitstamp.net as my next best option for buying and selling Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin to USD because I can make direct transfers from my bank account and quickly move Litecoin into an exchange where I can then buy anything else.
8.  **What exchange is working the best today to buy altcoins?**  Bittrex.com is where I am buying and selling most of my Steem and Steem Dollars into Bitcoin because the transactions complete in about half an hour total from sending SBD to Bittrex to having USD in my Coinbase wallet.  For buying into Steem, the reverse is true where I can have my USD changed into Steem in my wallet at the best rate in about thirty minutes.  Poloniex is what I used previously but many users have been unable to make withdrawals leaving me to suspect a crash is coming.
9. **When to invest?**  The ideal strategy to me seems to be to invest consistently over time because this minimizes the impact of volatile prices.  For example, if you decide you want to invest in Steem but are not sure if the price will be up or down later, buying in every month instead of all at once is often an ideal way to go forward because if the price goes down, you get a better deal next time.  If the price goes up, you got a good deal buying in initially.  If you feel the price is absolutely a great deal today, then buying in all at once can be a good strategy when combined with an ongoing investment plan to continue buying more in the future.  I bought into Steem all at once to begin and then bought more as the price dropped right after I bought it.  Today the price is up more and I am grateful just by making posts I am continuing to invest more as an author.  If the price takes a serious drop below a $1, I will begin buying in again with cash in addition to my author rewards because I believe the price will be over $10 in a few months.  In summary, investing over time is ideal because it helps account for the up and down prices more effectively.
10. **How about day trading crypto?**  While profits are possible trading cryptocurrencies, so are losses.  My first year involved me spending hundreds of hours trading Bitcoin with a result of losing over $5,000 with nothing to show for it.  Simply trading digital currencies is very similar to gambling because no one really knows what is going to happen next although anyone can guess!  While I was lucky to do nothing expect lose money when I started, the worst thing that can happen is to get lucky right away and get a big ego about what an amazing cryptocurrency trader we are.  The predictable result then is increasing the volume and risks in trades with eventually losing everything with again nothing to prove to anyone that we learned anything except a story.  If you are not aware of how the very top traders and companies rig the game to wipe out ordinary traders, then the odds are stacked against winning just as much as going to the casino.  I struggled with a gambling addiction not because I lost all the time but because sometimes I did win big but mostly lost.  The night I turned $10 into almost a thousand in college was followed by years of gambling compulsively with most nights resulting in losing all my money and occasionally turning a few dollars into a thousand.  Cryptocurrency trading is the same.  The systems are setup at the highest level to capitalize on the ups and downs with almost no risk and are great for consistently taking money from ordinary traders like me when I thought I was smarter than everyone else while allowing just enough good things to happen so the game continues to be played.  Avoid trading on all levels or risk the consequences of losing a lot of time and money overall even if initially or occasionally big success comes.
